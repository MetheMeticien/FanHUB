Manchester United collapse in Europe once again as Porto came back from two goals down after early strikes from Marcus Rashford and Rasmus Hojlund; Samu Omorordion's double and Pepe steered Porto in front before Harry Maguire struck in stoppage-time to save his under-fire manager for now

Harry Maguire's stoppage-time header rescued a point for Manchester United in Porto as they recovered from a stunning collapse to draw 3-3 in the Europa League despite Bruno Fernandes being sent off for the second game running.

United threw away an early two-goal lead after strikes from Marcus Rashford and Rasmus Hojlund and looked on course to have a nightmare evening when Fernandes, sent off against Tottenham, was given a second booking for a high foot nine minutes from time.

Porto struck twice in the space of seven minutes to go in level at the break as United wilted in Europe once again. Pepe poked in at the back post before Samu Omorodion, who nearly joined Chelsea in the summer, outmuscled Matthijs De Ligt to power in a header.

Rashford, the first-half's best player, was taken off at half-time for ""rotation"", Ten Hag said afterwards, leaving United blunt in attack, although he later suggested it was because of his defensive frailties.

Porto only needed five minutes after the restart to go ahead, Omorodion besting De Ligt again before scoring emphatically into the roof of the net. United escaped with a point at the death thanks to Maguire who nodded in Christian Eriksen's corner.

United, winless in four games, remain in the knockout play-off spots in 21st after two draws. Porto are also just in the same bracket in 24th after claiming their first point in the new Europa League format.

Ten Hag asked fans for patience once again after the game, telling TNT Sports: ""We will get there. Don't judge us in this moment, judge us at the end of the season. We are in the process, we will improve.""

United bosses backed Ten Hag after humiliation against Tottenham, but the nature of this performance only adds to the pressure on the manager. A tough trip to Aston Villa awaits on Sunday - live on Sky Sports.

Ten Hag failed to learn his lesson from resting Rashford at Crystal Palace for last month's stalemate just when he was finding form and it cost him in Porto.

Rashford was the star turn for United in the first half, scoring and assisting, so it was a surprise to see him being replaced by Alejandro Garnacho before the restart.

""We have to rotate,"" Ten Hag told TNT Sports, asked about the decision. ""We didn't start Garnacho, but he had a great game not only Sunday but the whole season.

""We go quickly with a turnaround to Villa and they have had a day longer to recover and we have an away game.""

Rashford had been the source of United's best attacking moments in the first half and finished with a game-high eight touches in the opposition box despite playing only 45 minutes.

The forward's loss was felt in the second half as Garnacho struggled against Porto right-back Joao Mario, who Rashford seemed to have the beating of.

Going the other way, the 26-year-old was less convincing. It was Joao Mario that delivered the cross for Porto's first goal, Rashford watching on a few yards back. Ten Hag later suggested this might have been behind the change.

Asked if the decision had anything to do with Rashford's role in Porto's first goal, Ten Hag said: ""As I say, I have to watch it back and I think over the left side definitely we didn't defend well tonight.

""Marcus also played a part in this but, as I say, it had to do with Garnacho and nothing against Rashy.""

For a manager under so much pressure right now, removing your best attacking player with the game level seems a perplexing decision. It appears to have backfired. Villa on Sunday becomes an even bigger game as a result.

The seven-minute collapse that led to Porto overturning the early two-goal deficit felt familiar for United in Europe. It was a common occurrence in last season's disastrous Champions League campaign that ended in them finishing bottom of their group.

Ten Hag's side conceded two goals in four minutes at Bayern Munich and Copenhagen, and then twice within 10 minutes home and away against Galatasaray. A year has passed, with five signings made for more than £200m, but the same chaotic team remains.

Once Pepe scored Porto's first, on the rebound after Andre Onana kept out Noussair Mazraoui's inadvertent header, it only felt a matter of time before the equaliser followed.

These are the concerning characteristics of the team that Ten Hag cannot hide from, regardless of his trophy return or the outcome of the game. This is an unsustainable style of football.

This is a team that never looks safe, even with a two-goal lead.

Ten Hag told TNT Sports after the game: ""We started very good, we dominated, scored two goals then we lost control.

""The start was good, the middle was not good then we finished very good. It's a tough place to go, we're coming back from 3-2 and we get the equaliser. The team has a strong character, but the middle part we have to improve.

""We need to be better on the ball, keep switching. We had good players, a good plan. We have to defend better. We had three clean sheets not a long time ago so we can defend very good, but we have to go back to those habits.""

He added: ""We will get there. Don't judge us in this moment, judge us at the end of the season. We are in the process, we will improve. We have had two seasons where we have reached finals, we will continue and fight.

""You see the spirit and the connection between the staff and the team. The players are together, they have a strong spirit and they want to achieve. We have a good mentality but in some defending parts we have to step up.""

Maguire was only on the pitch for his goal, it seemed, because De Ligt and Lisandro Martinez had endured such a torrid evening trying to deal with Omorodion. They were lost.

This was a performance that announced the 20-year-old on the European stage. He now has seven goals in his last five games and Porto appear to have a gem on their hands.

Omorodion was a threat from start to finish and tormented De Ligt, fresh from a difficult display against Spurs, with both his goals coming when up against the Netherlands defender.

Chelsea passed up on the chance to sign Omorodion from Atletico Madrid in the summer after contractual issues held up the transfer. They turned to Joao Felix instead as the player to unlock Conor Gallagher's move to the Spanish capital.

There may be a few wistful onlookers at Stamford Bridge now.

Ten Hag explains shock Rashford sub,"Football

Man Utd boss Erik ten Hag on Marcus Rashford's substitution: ""We have to rotate. We go quickly with a turnaround to Villa and they have had a day longer to recover and we have an away game."" | Watch Aston Villa vs Man Utd live Sky Sports on Sunday; kick off 2pm

Thursday 3 October 2024 23:57, UK

Erik ten Hag revealed rotation was the reason for Marcus Rashford's surprise substitution at half-time in Man Utd's 3-3 draw with Porto in the Europa League on Thursday.

Rashford had been United's best performer in the first half, scoring his side's opener before teeing up Rasmus Hojlund as Ten Hag's side flew out of the traps and surged into a 2-0 lead.

Speaking on Sky Sports News about Rashford's first-half performance, former Wales striker Robert Earnshaw said: ""Marcus Rashford has been excellent.

""Every time he gets the ball on the left he is terrifying Porto. He looks the most dangerous player on the pitch for Man Utd.""

Former Wales striker Robert Earnshaw:


""The biggest danger to Porto in the first half was Rashford.


""It has to be injury because there is no way you would make that change.""


Sky Sports' Oliver Yew:


""Surely it's an injury to Marcus Rashford?


""He was excellent in the first half. Man Utd's best player by a mile.""

However, United were pegged back before the break as Porto pulled a goal back through Pepe and Samu Omorodion equalised before half-time.

Rashford didn't re-emerge for the second half and was replaced by Alejandro Garnacho, with speculation mounting that he must have picked up an injury. However, after the game Ten Hag explained the substitution was all part of the plan as he looked ahead to the Super Sunday clash with Aston Villa, live on Sky Sports.

""We have to rotate,"" Ten Hag said.

""Garnacho, we didn't start him, but he had a great game not only Sunday but the whole season.

""We go quickly with a turnaround to Villa and they have had a day longer to recover and we have an away game.""

In his post-match press conference, Ten Hag added: ""Yeah, but (replacement Alejandro) Garnacho was my best player on Sunday by far and also in many other games,"" he said.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player

""I think in the season, as I assess it so far, he is bringing us so far the offensive threat by creating chances, assists, also scoring.

""Garnacho we also have to play as well and we have two very good players over that side.""

Asked if the decision had anything to do with Rashford's role in Porto's first goal, Ten Hag said: ""As I say, I have to watch it back and I think over the left side definitely we didn't defend well tonight.

""Marcus also played a part in this but, as I say, it had to do with Garnacho and nothing against Rashy.""

Erik ten Hag accepts Manchester United must do better than squandering a 2-0 lead.


“We started the game very good, scored two good goals, but then we lost control. The start was good, the middle part was no good, then we finished very good.


“It is a tough place to go and we are coming back from a 3-2, then get the equaliser, so it is good for the spirit.


“You see again that the team is willing, strong character, but the middle part, the defending we have to improve.


“We have to be better on the ball and defend better.”

Porto struck again soon after the restart through Omorodion's second of the game and United, who were reduced to 10 men with nine minutes left when captain Bruno Fernandes was sent off for the second successive game after collecting a second yellow card for a high boot, looked to be heading for another damaging defeat.

However, Ten Hag's side dug in to salvage a draw when substitute Harry Maguire headed in from a corner during stoppage time.

Despite the point, United, who remain in the knockout play-off spots in 21st after a second draw, are winless in four games and the nature of this performance only adds to the pressure on Ten Hag ahead of the tough trip to Aston Villa on Sunday.

Pressed on his future, the Dutchman remained defiant, saying: ""We will get there. Don't judge us in this moment, judge us at the end of the season.

""We are in the process, we will improve. We have two seasons now where we achieve finals, (so) just wait.

""We have to develop and progress this team. We will work and continue and we will fight.

""You see the spirit and the connection between the staff and the team, the players are together and want to achieve. We have that good mentality, but some defending parts we have to step up.""

United have now conceded three or more times in a match on 24 occasions in all competitions since Ten Hag took over - more than any Premier League side has in that period.

This was the third time they have conceded three in a game this season alone.

However, goal scorer Maguire went on to back Ten Hag to use his experience to pull United through this difficult spell.

""I have played for this club for six years and I know how it works,"" Maguire said.

""When you go through a bad spell, players come under pressure, but also the manager does.

""He [Ten Hag] is experienced enough, he has been in the game long enough and has been at this club long enough, so I am sure he has learnt how to deal with it.

""It is part and parcel of playing for or managing this club, part of the privilege that you have.""

Harry Maguire accepts Manchester United need to be more solid after allowing Porto to fight their way back from 2-0 down to draw 3-3 in the Europa League.


The defender said: “When you get 2-0 up away from home at a place like this, you have to be a bit more solid and secure.


“There were far too many gaps, too many crosses coming into the box and they ultimately punished us for it.


“We played really well with the ball in the first half, we just have to do more without it.


“It probably starts with belief – when we go 2-0 up and then we concede, it is just the belief that goes a bit between the boys that we can go on and win the game.


“It is something that we need to be aware of and focus on, to really make sure that when we do concede we get together, regroup and stick together, because that is part and parcel of football and something we have to do better.”

Match report from the Conference League league phase match between Chelsea and KAA Gent at Stamford Bridge on Thursday night; goals from Renato Veiga, Pedri Neto, Christopher Nkunku and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall help Enzo Maresca's Blues to a second successive 4-2 win

Thursday 3 October 2024 23:44, UK

Chelsea justified their tag as favourites to win the Conference League as they eased to a 4-2 win over Belgian side Gent at Stamford Bridge.

The largely comprehensive victory represented the fourth time in 10 games in all competitions this term the Blues have scored four or more goals, with each goal scored by a different player on Thursday night.

Gent forced Chelsea back with a high line at the start, restricting the Blues' options as they looked to get the ball forward. The first 10 minutes were frustrating as a result, then something clicked and the hosts edged in front when Renato Veiga headed in his first goal for the club after attacking a high ball hung up by Mykhailo Mudryk.

The Belgian side then changed tack and adopted a more conservative approach, allowing Chelsea the lion's share of the ball and putting bodies on the line to prevent them from doubling the lead, which looked an inevitability.

But when Enzo Maresca's side failed to do so, Gent grew in confidence. England U20 international Archie Brown surged forward and drove a low shot at Filip Jorgensen, while Andri Gudjohnsen - son of Chelsea legend Eidur - got between two defenders and flashed a shot millimetres over the crossbar.

The game sprung into life inside the first five minutes of the second half. Pedro Neto took advantage of a defensive lapse to lash in 38 seconds after the whistle, but Tsuyoshi Watanabe headed in a Gudjohnsen cross, which halved the deficit again, after a VAR check for offside.

Just past the hour, Christopher Nkunku arrived to smash in the third after Veiga struggled to get a shot away of his own and, seven minutes later, a tackle took Joao Felix's pass out of the path of Nkunku, but Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall was there to hit a shot that slipped through goalkeeper Davy Roef's hands and into the net.

Despite going 4-1 down, Gent rallied and did finally get another back to limit the damage late on, when ex-MK Dons forward Max Dean pulled the ball back for fellow substitute Omri Gandelman to slot home and sent the vocal travelling fans home happy.

Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca told TNT Sports:

""Good performance. It was a tough game and we approached it well very. It's a shame the second goal we conceded, we can avoid that.

""Every game is complicated. We have many things we can do better - attack better, defend better.

""The ones who play tonight it doesn't mean they won't play the next game.

""I know Kiernan very well. I know when you are the main player and then move to a big club it's not easy because you're not the main player. Sometimes you struggle a bit at the beginning so I was very happy for him.""

Chelsea goalscorer Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall told TNT Sports:

""I'm over the moon. I've been waiting for that moment since joining the club, to show everyone what my qualities are.

""Scoring the goal is an amazing feeling. I won't forget this night.

""I pride myself on working as hard as I can every day. I'd like to play more but it's my duty to make sure the manager has a decision to make. I feel fresh.

""I've loved it. You come through the door and expectations are through the roof. The standards are so high. It's so nice to play with players on your wavelength - top, top players.

""It's about learning and evolving. That's literally what I'm here for.

""He [Enzo Maresca] is a breath of fresh air. I was taken aback by him last year. Everything he did was passionate and motivated. You can see the lads are buying into it.""

Match report as Alexandre Lacazette and Malick Fofana score two goals apiece 
in Lyon's 4-1 Europa League win against Rangers as the French side record their third consecutive victory at Ibrox

Thursday 3 October 2024 23:41, UK

Lyon captain Alexandre Lacazette scored a wonder goal as he and Malick Fofana scored twice in a punishing 4-1 Europa League defeat for Rangers at Ibrox.

James Tavernier spurned an early chance, before Vlacav Cerny missed a sitter from seven yards, only for Lyon to go in front moments later through Fofana's cool finish after Rayan Cherki's excellent close control and assist.

Rangers hit back almost instantaneously with Tom Lawrence getting his second goal in consecutive games before he ws replaced at half-time with an injury. The midfielder capitalised after Cyriel Dessers failed to convert following a disastrous Corentin Tolisso header back toward goal.

But Lyon were back in front before the game reached the midway point after Connor Barron's blind pass was latched on to by Belgian teenager Fofana, who dribbled towards the area and squared for Lacazette to calmly slot home.

The highlight of the first half was still to come with Lacazette scoring a screamer from outside of the box.

The Lyon skipper cut across from the left before unleashing a right-footed effort that flew across Jack Butland and into the top corner in first-half added time.

Lyon captain Alexandre Lacazette took his goal tally for the club to 183 after scoring twice in the 4-1 Europa League win over Rangers.

Fofana slotted home the fourth early in the second half after more great work from Cherki, and though Lyon remained unsteady in defence at times, their attacking threat was constant, with Duje Caleta-Car hitting the bar with a header before Rangers substitute Neraysho Kasanwirjo cleared Tolisso's header off the line.

Rangers kept going forward and Lyon goalkeeper Lucas Perri made a good save from a Kieran Dowell volley. But Butland was forced to prevent substitute Said Benrahma making it five late on with a fine block, and Lyon's threat did not end until the final whistle confirmed a chastening defeat for the Ibrox men.

Rangers goalkeeper Jack Butland to TNT Sports:

""They have got some serious individual quality. The disappointment for us is that we gave them too many opportunities to showcase that.

""I wish we could do it over again because I think, you hate to say it, but there was a different approach that we needed or there wasn't quite enough from us in those moments to cut out the attack, make a foul stop them from getting in their stride.

""So the disappointment is we gave them some easy opportunities to showcase some serious individual talent. In that sense, it probably feels like one that looks worse than it is, but we caused our own issues.""

Rangers manager Philippe Clement:

""I think we started the game with good intentions, with good intensity, with good quality also.

""To put fire in the stands, to have an amazing European evening, when you have two 100 per cent chances, the first two chances of the game, you need to kill them off to get a special European night.

""We did a lot of good things, but the goalkeeper made a really good save for the chance of Tav, but he could have put the ball also sideways, where we have two players totally free to tap the ball in, and Vaclav is also a tap-in to a free goal.

""So I don't think we can do much more than creating those kinds of chances, I don't think you can create better chances than that, but you need to kill them off. Against teams with this quality, you don't get so many chances, so that's disappointing.

""But 1-4 is a really harsh result, if you see. In the end, it's the same amount of chances that both teams have, and we had more in the first half, but it was 1-3 with half-time, and that's the difference in quality. So it's a big working point for us.""

Sky Sports' Kris Boyd:

""The front three of Lacazette, Cherki and Fofana ripped Rangers apart - they were outstanding. Rangers struggled with their pace and trickery. It was four, it could have been more.

""It's hard to believe Rangers have lost 4-1 in Europe and it's not even the worst result in Europe for a Scottish team this week.

Lyon have won their last three matches at Ibrox following previous victories in 2007 and 2021.

""Rangers don't control games at their tempo. It's either really slow or hectic. The turnover in possession for Rangers was really poor. That is something to build on.

""It's a big couple of weeks coming up for Rangers.""

Scotland well beaten by Bangladesh in Women's T20 World Cup debut,"Cricket

Watch every game of the 2024 ICC Women's T20 World Cup live on Sky Sports; England face Bangladesh in their tournament opener on Saturday - live on Sky Sports Cricket from 2.30pm (first ball, 3pm)

Scotland slipped to a 16-run defeat to Bangladesh in their first ever Women's T20 World Cup match and the 2024 tournament opener in the searing heat of Sharjah.

Saskia Horley (3-13) picked up three wickets at the back end of the Bangladesh innings to limit them to 119-7 from their 20 overs and though Sarah Bryce anchored the chase with a fine 49 not out from 52 balls, Scotland lost regular wickets at the other end to fall short of their victory target.

It's Bangladesh's first T20 World Cup win for 10 years, spanning 16 matches, since beating Ireland when hosting the 2014 tournament. They next face Heather Knight's England on Sunday - live on Sky Sports Cricket from 2.30pm (first ball, 3pm).

After Bangladesh won the toss and elected to bat first, Shathi Rani (29 off 32) and Sobhana Mostary (36 off 38) showed good intent to see the Tigers off to a positive start.

Scotland captain Kathryn Bryce claimed the team's first T20 World Cup wicket when picking up Murshida Khatun for 12, while spinners Olivia Bell (1-23), Katherine Fraser (1-23) and Abtaha Maqsood (0-24) bowled tidily to stem the scoring.

Fraser saw off Shathi, while a run out did for Taj Nehar four balls later, gone for a duck. A sharp stumping from Sarah Bryce ended Mostary's knock, while she would claim another late in the innings - Ritu Moni (5) falling off a far more flukey ricochet onto the stumps - as part of Horley's late haul.

Scotland were left to chase 120, but they could have been left with an even more modest target but for putting down three catches in a sloppy fielding effort.

Sarah Bryce was brilliant in carrying her bat through the innings but sadly lacked support at the other end, with sister Kathryn Bryce (11) and Ailsa Lister (11) the only other two batters into double figures as Scotland limped to defeat in sweltering conditions - failing to find the boundary for the final 54 balls of the innings.

Ritu was the pick of the Bangladesh bowlers, the seamer claiming 2-15 from her four overs.

Bangladesh look to build on their opening win with a tricky second match against England on Saturday, Heather Knight's side playing their first match of the tournament.

As Artur Beterbiev and Dmitry Bivol fight to decide light-heavyweight supremacy, the Fabio Wardley versus Frazer Clarke heavyweight rematch is sure to be 'brutal'. Sky Sports' boxing expert Johnny Nelson appraises the big October 12 bill.

I believe Artur Beterbiev can end Dmitry Bivol's unbeaten run.

Beterbiev boxed Oleksandr Usyk in the amateurs and the style of fight was relentless. He was determined. Just wouldn't let go and I think he'll do exactly the same again.

In a dictionary, if you had the perfect boxers, the perfect warriors, it would be a picture of one of these two fighters. They are the perfect warrior. No one's going to take a backwards step.

One's going to try and box and outfox, and one's going to try and walk through iron. It is going to be such a fight. But I'm going Beterbiev because I think he's the real deal.

He's a brilliant offensive fighter - hardly takes a backwards step. He's not baffled by any skullduggery.

I think Bivol will try and outbox him but he won't. Beterbiev will cover up. He'll take the shots. He'll see what you've got. You'll hit him with a shot and he'll instantly react with a shot. He'll cover up for a split second then turn it on and he'll throw three, four, five shot combinations and not leave you alone.

For Fabio Wardley and Frazer Clarke I don't think we can expect anything else but round 13. This fight rolls on. We did a Gloves are Off with them last week and even though they don't dislike each other that professionalism is there. Their careers, as far as Clarke's concerned, depend on it. Because he's thinking I can't afford to lose to this guy.

This fight was just brutal from the off. Wardley - constant, consistent pressure. Clarke, inexperienced as a professional but still stuck it out and dug in deep. They were absolutely exhausted. But the pace they had for heavyweights was mad.

When Clarke went down, he had to dig deep in his soul and think I'm not losing.

It takes a lot for a fighter to think I'm going to go through all that again. That's why I call it round 13.

Clarke's got to understand what he did wrong. He's got to understand where he slipped up.

He had to answer a question that he'd never been asked before as a professional - could he box at that pace as a professional fighter?

Wardley's been there, he's been in the trenches. As far as he's concerned the pressure's on Clarke more than it is on him.

Wardley believes this fight doesn't go the distance so he's going for the stoppage.

Both fighters are very capable of stopping each other, we saw that. Wardley probably looked the more concussive puncher of the two but I've got to give credit to Clarke. He was going through something new.

It's going to be an exciting fight.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player

Chris Eubank Jr is one of the very few fighters who is in such a powerful position to have no titles. You want to watch him box.

That air of mystique about him is not about what he says, it's about what he doesn't say. He's very matter-of-fact. Very much like his father, there's something about him that you either love or loathe.

I personally don't think we've seen the best of him.

Ben Whittaker reminds me of Prince Naseem Hamed.

Ben Whittaker has everything going for him. He says it. He walks it. He talks it. He can box, he can be flash. He can get your imagination going. You're looking thinking I want to see him get hit.

If he can take this to world level, Ben Whittaker will be our next superstar.

Johnson continues red-hot form to earn second Spurs victory in EL,"Football

Match report as Tottenham beat Ferencvaros to earn second Europa League victory; Pape Sarr nets opener for Spurs after hosts have goal ruled out for offside; Johnson comes off bench to scores his fifth goal in five games; Barnabas Varga bags late goal for hosts

Thursday 3 October 2024 23:43, UK

Brennan Johnson scored his fifth goal in five games as Tottenham won 2-1 at Hungarian side Ferencvaros to earn their second Europa League victory.

Johnson came off the bench in the second half to continue his red-hot streak although Spurs' latest triumph in Europe, with a much-changed team from their 3-0 win at Manchester United that featured first starts for youngsters Mikey Moore and Will Lankshear, wasn't straightforward.

Pape Sarr gave Ange Postecoglou's youthful side the lead against the run of play in the 23rd minute with a close-range finish that fell kindly to him in the box after two ricochets. The hosts had seen Barnabas Varga's header ruled out for a tight offside and forced Guglielmo Vicario into a spectacular reaction save.

Pedro Porro hit the foot of the left post before the break and in the second half 19-year-old striker Lankshear volleyed inches over at a corner. Timo Werner continued Spurs' wastefulness in front of goal, hitting the side-netting after trying to round the goalkeeper.

However, Johnson injected quality and confidence to the final third. His powerful, first-time shot that was heading for the top-left corner struck the crossbar and moments later he slotted home in off the left post with four minutes to play.

The hosts, to their credit, pushed Spurs until the end with Varga finally getting his goal and beating Vicario with a smart finish from a low cross in the 90th minute.

The future looks bright for Tottenham. For the first time since February 2009, Spurs started four teenagers in a major European match - and they didn't disappoint.

Archie Gray, 18, once again showed his versatility by partnering Cristian Romero at centre-back and then later when moved to left-back. Lucas Bergvall, at the same age, looked composed in midfield while Will Lankshear, 19, put himself in goal-scoring positions.

But it was the 17-year-old Mikey Moore who shone brightest. The winger was fearless even after being on the receiving end of a strong challenge within minutes of kick-off.

""His ability to deal with pressure and keep the ball in really tight areas and make good, really clear decisions"" impressed manager Ange Postecoglou the most.

He added: ""I couldn't be happier for him but also pretty pleased that he's part of our football club."" Spurs have a gem.

Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou said:

""We made quite a number of changes to the team, including bringing the young boys in but I thought they handled it really well.

""We defended well, played some good football, created some good chances, maybe could have had a couple more and most importantly won an away European tie which is a credit to the lads.""

On Mikey Moore: ""He was outstanding. For a 17-year-old to play 90 minutes in a European away tie, he handled it superbly - I knew he would. It'll help his growth. I didn't feel like I needed to take him off, he still looked strong at the end and was still contributing.""

Carsley calls up Solanke but leaves out Maguire and overlooks Maddison again,"Football

Dominic Solanke has been recalled after a seven-year absence, while Harry Maguire is left out and James Maddison is overlooked again; England face Greece at Wembley on October 10 and travel to Finland on October 13 as their Nations League campaign continues under interim boss Lee Carsley

Thursday 3 October 2024 23:05, UK

Dominic Solanke has received his first England call-up in seven years but Harry Maguire has been left out of the latest squad named by interim boss Lee Carsley.

Solanke, 27, has scored three goals in his past three appearances for Tottenham and will now have the chance to add to his solitary England cap, which he earned as a sub against Brazil in a friendly in 2017, when the Three Lions face Greece and Finland in the Nations League this month.

However, Carsley - who continues to oversee the national team while the FA decides on a permanent successor to Gareth Southgate - has left Manchester United centre-back Maguire out of his group. The defender missed United's defeat to Tottenham on Sunday with an injury but was in the club's travelling squad to play Porto in the Europa League on Thursday night. ​​​​

""Harry was very positive in the conversation we had,"" said Carsley about Maguire, who featured during last month's Nations League opener against Republic of Ireland. ""It was a case of talking about what the decision was, we have some really good centre-backs who are keen to play. Harry still has an important part to play in this squad in the campaign.""

Solanke's Spurs team-mate James Maddison has once again been overlooked by the interim boss, while Jarrod Bowen and Eberechi Eze - who appeared as subs in both fixtures last month - have been dropped, as has Tino Livramento.

Jude Bellingham is back in the fold after missing the September games with injury, as is Kyle Walker.

Morgan Rogers, who has made an impressive start to the season for Aston Villa, is set to once again be with the U21 squad rather than the seniors.

""It was a chance to have a look at other players,"" said Carsley on the omissions. ""It's nothing to do with form. It's looking at the next two camps to look at other players.

""The players left out all have a case but we saw the benefit in the last camp of the squad being fresh, feeling fresh and a lot of energy in it. It's not just a copy and a paste, I want them to feel like they all have earned their place in the squad. People want to know where they stand long-term, I've told all the players this is a short-term situation.""

England currently sit second in their Nations League Group B2, level on points with Greece having beaten Ireland and Finland in Carsley's first two games in charge.

England will host Greece at Wembley on Thursday October 10 before going to Finland on Sunday October 13.

Goalkeepers: Jordan Pickford (Everton), Dean Henderson (Crystal Palace), Nick Pope (Newcastle).

Defenders: Trent Alexander-Arnold (Liverpool), Levi Colwill (Chelsea), Marc Guehi (Crystal Palace), Ezri Konsa (Aston Villa), John Stones (Man City), Rico Lewis (Man City), Kyle Walker (Man City).

Midfielders: Conor Gallagher (Atletico Madrid), Kobbie Mainoo (Man Utd), Morgan Gibbs-White (Nottm Forest), Angel Gomes (Lille), Declan Rice (Arsenal), Cole Palmer (Chelsea), Phil Foden (Man City), Jude Bellingham (Real Madrid).

Forwards: Noni Madueke (Chelsea), Jack Grealish (Man City), Anthony Gordon (Newcastle), Harry Kane (Bayern Munich), Bukayo Saka (Arsenal), Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa), Dominic Solanke (Tottenham).

Sky Sports' Sam Blitz:

The usual annual James Maddison cycle goes: start the season really well, get into the England squad, get injured or see a drop-off in form and then miss out on the Three Lions spot.

This year, however, Maddison has started the season brilliantly for Tottenham and that still is not enough to get into Lee Carsley's set-up.

The midfielder's absence from this squad is particularly surprising given Dominic Solanke has been named in this England squad.

The pair have been excellent together in the Spurs attack but only one has made the cut. Is it the right call?

Sky Sports' Peter Smith:

Seven years. It's been a long wait for Dominic Solanke to return to the England fold but the in-form Tottenham forward gets his chance to add to his solitary cap this month. And deservedly so, given the performances of the former Chelsea and Liverpool forward for Bournemouth last season and in his initial outings for new club Spurs.

Solanke - who has three in three for his club - made his England debut as a sub against Brazil in a 2017 friendly at Wembley. He will be aiming to run out at the national stadium again next Thursday. There will be plenty of competition for game time, though, with Harry Kane and Ollie Watkins also included...

Sky Sports' Nick Wright:

I'm firmly in agreement with Jamie Carragher. Cole Palmer is too good not to start for England. With six goals and four assists in the Premier League this season, to add to the 22 and 11 respectively he contributed last term, he continues to scale new heights.

Time to give him the keys and that means putting him at No 10. The 22-year-old is just as effective from the right, of course. But Bukayo Saka's quality and consistency make him undroppable, in my opinion. It therefore makes most sense to have Palmer on the inside.

Readjustment would be required elsewhere to make this work. But I think it's worth it. Jude Bellingham can drop deeper, into a box-to-box role alongside Declan Rice. Phil Foden, meanwhile, has to wait in the wings, with Anthony Gordon's pace making him an invaluable outlet on the left flank.

If he is not given the keys to the England squad just yet, interim boss Lee Carsley might opt to use Cole Palmer in more surprising roles across the starting lineup.

Carsley has praised the versatility of the Chelsea star ahead of the upcoming international break, while also admitting he could play in the holding midfield role.

""You just want Cole on the ball,"" he said when asked about Palmer's best position.

""Any area that he is on the ball, he is effective. He stands out so much because we haven't always produced these types of players who can receive the ball under pressure, play forward, be creative and play numerous positions.

""We are producing players that are multi-positional and can do different things. Can play deep, wide, as a nine and a ten.

""For the 21s we played him as a holding midfielder.""

Carsley was later asked about who could potentially fill the void at left-back with Luke Shaw yet to return to full fitness, where he added: ""[Trent Alexander-Arnold] he can play there. Bukayo [Saka] and Cole can play there.

""There's quite a few but you want to get the best out of them in their most natural positions. It's important that we aren't predictable.""

England host Greece at Wembley on October 10 at 7.45pm. Lee Carsely's men then travel to the Helsinki Olympic Stadium to take on Finland on October 13 at 5pm.

Humphries denies Bunting to clinch Players Championship crown,"Darts

Luke Humphries fought back from 7-6 adrift to beat Stephen Bunting 8-7; The 29-year-old is preparing for the defence of his World Grand Prix crown next week, live on Sky Sports

Thursday 3 October 2024 21:39, UK

Luke Humphries clinched his maiden Players Championship title of 2024 in Wigan on Thursday, producing a late burst to deny Stephen Bunting in a compelling final.

Humphries fought back from 7-6 adrift to triumph 8-7 at the Robin Park Tennis Centre, marking the perfect preparation ahead of his BoyleSports World Grand Prix title defence next week.

The world number one will play Bunting in a blockbuster opening-round tie in Leicester on Monday, and he struck an early psychological blow to secure his third ranking title of the campaign.

""This was important for me. You go through spells where you're playing fantastic darts, and then you go through spells where you can't buy a win, and that can happen,"" said Humphries

""I'm dedicated to this sport and I know I can push the levels higher and higher, but it's important to gain a bit of confidence from somewhere.""

Humphries will return to big-stage action at the Mattioli Arena on Monday to defend his World Grand Prix title, live on Sky Sports.

""When you're on the big stage, it feels different. I feel better than ever on that big stage,"" added the World Champion.

""I know I've got a really tough game against Stephen because he's usually so strong on his doubles, but these are the moments I live for now.

""I want to play the best and be involved in these great games, and hopefully it's a great World Grand Prix. I would love to retain it.""

Humphries kicked off Thursday's action with wins over George Killington and Callum Goffin, before accounting for Connor Scutt and Josh Rock in reaching the last eight.

The 29-year-old then recovered from 4-2 down to topple top seed Dave Chisnall, before fending off a semi-final fightback from Luke Woodhouse, who rallied from 6-2 down to force a decider.

The opening six legs of Thursday's showpiece were shared, although Humphries established some daylight at 5-3, punishing five missed darts at double across two legs from Bunting.

However, the St Helens star responded to regain the initiative, following up legs of 14 and 11 darts with a clinical 72 to move to the cusp of victory at 7-6.

Humphries wasn't to be denied though, converting a two-dart 83 outshot to set up a last-leg shoot-out, where he produced a 12-dart break of throw to secure the spoils.

Bunting - also a runner-up on Tuesday and Wednesday - performed magnificently throughout the afternoon to progress to his third Players Championship final in as many days.

Following early wins against Joshua Richardson and Stefan Bellmont, Bunting registered a quartet of ton-plus averages to progress to his fifth Players Championship final of the season.

The Masters champion followed up a 6-1 demolition of Josh Payne with a brace of 6-4 wins against Radek Szaganski and Robert Owen, before defeating Raymond van Barneveld 7-6 in the semi-finals.

Van Barneveld was one of Thursday's stand-out performers, whitewashing William O'Connor and Jeffrey de Zwaan, while averaging 105 and 104 in crushing wins against Mensur Suljovic and Luke Littler respectively.

The Dutch icon then won through a deciding-leg tussle against his compatriot Danny Noppert in the quarter-finals, although his bid for a second ProTour title of 2024 was halted by a brilliant Bunting.

Woodhouse also impressed in his run to the last four, coming from 5-1 down in his opening-round tie against Adam Gawlas, before averaging almost 106 to see off Ryan Meikle.

The 35-year-old produced more late heroics to overcome Andy Boulton in round three, which was backed up by victories against Dutch duo Wessel Nijman and Christian Kist.

Former Lakeside champion Kist was joined in the last four by his fellow Dutchman Noppert, with Chisnall and Owen making up the quarter-final line-up.

Ritchie Edhouse and Lee Evans also achieved personal milestones in Wigan, with Evans firing in a nine-darter during his superb first round victory over Dirk van Duijvenbode.

Edhouse, meanwhile, recorded an astonishing 120.24 average to whitewash Graham Hall at the same stage, reeling off legs of 12, 10, 13, 14, 15 and 11 darts to cap off the performance of his career.

The 2024 PDC ProTour season resumes later this month, as the Robin Park Tennis Centre plays host to Players Championships 27-28 on October 15-16.

Humphries celebrated his maiden TV ranking title with victory over Gerwyn Price in last year's tournament, and the world No 1 will begin his title defence against Masters champion Stephen Bunting as he bids to join Phil Taylor and Michael van Gerwen in becoming the third player to retain the coveted crown.

Monday's opening night will see eight first-round ties take place at the Mattioli Arena, as teenage sensation Littler makes his World Grand Prix debut against fourth seed Rob Cross.

Live darts returns to Sky Sports with the BoyleSports World Grand Prix in Leicester from October 7-13, featuring some of the sport's very biggest stars.

The annual £600,000 tournament will take place at the Mattioli Arena in Leicester from October 7-13, as 32 of the world's top stars compete for the coveted title which was won by Luke Humphries.

Then in November, the Grand Slam of Darts will be hosted in Wolverhampton as Luke Humphries looks to defend his title.

Attention then turns to the turn of the year and the 2025 PDC World Darts Championship, beginning on December 15, as the darts calendar continues to provide excitement throughout the year - and you can enjoy the very best here live on Sky Sports.

FIFA to make clubs take strongest squads to Club World Cup,"Football

Man City and Chelsea are the only English teams taking part and FIFA regulations mean they will not be able to allow any players to miss the tournament - which takes place from June 15 to July 13 next summer in the USA - after a long season of domestic and European football

Clubs participating in next summer's Club World Cup will have to take their strongest squads and field their strongest teams.

FIFA's expanded new 32-team tournament is scheduled to take place in the United States from June 15 to July 13 next summer.

Manchester City and Chelsea are the only English teams taking part and FIFA regulations mean they will not be able to allow any players to miss the tournament after a long season of domestic and European football.

In a further move to make sure squads are as strong as possible, FIFA will allow the member associations of all participating teams to open their transfer window from June 1-10 2025 so new signings can be registered before the tournament starts on June 15.

Clubs can also replace players during a restricted in-competition period from June 27 to July 3 within a set limit and according to specific limitations, including the fact that a ""standard"" registration window must be open for the club at the time.

Players whose contracts expire on June 30 2025 will be allowed to extend their deals until July 13 so they can play in the whole tournament. For example, Manchester City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne could take advantage of this special dispensation if he has not extended his City contract by then.

The regulations of the tournament will also stipulate that no player will be able to play for more than one team in the Club World Cup.

Playing in the tournament will not count towards rules limiting the number of clubs a player can represent to a maximum of three in one season. There will also be no obligation for teams to release players for international duty during the tournament.

The new regulations were agreed at the FIFA Council meeting in Zurich on Thursday. FIFA wants to make sure the best players play in the tournament and it believes the rules will ensure there is a level playing field for all participating clubs.

Meanwhile, European clubs are discussing proposals for the leading leagues to close their summer transfer windows simultaneously before their seasons start in the middle of August.

Before its revamp for the 2025 tournament, the Club World Cup took place every year in December and was contested by the winners of continental club competitions from around the world.

For example, the winners of the UEFA Champions League would take part in the tournament every year and face off against continental counterparts from South America (CONMEBOL), Asia (AFC), Africa (CAF), North America (CONCACAF) and Oceania (OFC).

But then FIFA announced in December that the competition would be expanded to 32 club teams and would take place every four years.

To replace the annual competition, an Intercontinental Cup will be played annually and have the UEFA Champions League winner playing in the final against a team that comes through intercontinental playoffs.

The tournament format works exactly the same as the FIFA World Cup, only for clubs.

The 32 teams will be divided into eight groups of four teams with the top two teams in each group qualifying to the knockout stage.

The last 16 stage then moves to the quarter-final, semi-final and then final - but there is not third-placed play-off between the two losing semi-final teams.

The draw for the 2025 Club World Cup will take place in December 2024.

Managers slam referee 'mistakes' as Celtic come back for SWPL draw with Rangers,"Football

Match report and free highlights as Celtic Women came from two-nil down to rescue a point against Rangers Women; Kirsty Howat and Katie Wilkinson goals cancelled out by Saoirse Noonan and Celya Barclais

Celya Barclais' late goal rescued Celtic a point as they came from 2-0 down to draw 2-2 with Scottish Women's Premier League leaders Rangers.

Both Jo Potter and Elena Sadiku walked away from the fixture questioning several decisions made by the referee on the evening.

The Celtic boss was one of 10 yellow cards dished out throughout the fixture, as she protested the penalty given to Rangers, which Katie Wilkinson eventually converted.

Sadiku claimed the first goal, which was scored by Kirsty Howat, should not have stood due to offside

Rangers saw a header from Tessel Middag chalked off from a similar situation shortly after they had opened the scoring.

""Quite fortunate with the goal. The second was called offside but the first was very similar.""

""If you look at the first goal, it's offside,"" Sadiku told Sky Sports. ""The second one, the penalty is outside the box. That's why I got the yellow card. Sometimes the referees make mistakes.""

Potter added: ""You're in the Old Firm, you have to manage games. A lot of decisions that I'm scratching my head with.""

It was a blistering start from Rangers, who were fired into an early lead thanks to a stunning volley from Howat in the fifth minute.

Middag thought she had doubled the lead for her side moments later, only to see her celebrations cut short by the offside flag.

Rio Hardy was deemed to have been obstructing Kelsey Renee Daugherty's view in the Celtic goal for the second, although the opener also involved a similar situation with the same player.

The second half was sparked into life with two quick-fire penalties, as both Wilkinson (64) and Saoirse Noonan (69) slotted the ball away with ease from the spot.

The latter scored with virtually her first touch off the bench and it was another substitute who netted the equaliser, as Barclais was first to react in the box to lash her effort into the bottom left corner in the 87th minute.

Rangers had conceded just one goal prior to this game but saw two fly past Victoria Esson in less than 20 minutes, as the points were shared in the Old Firm derby.

Celtic's Saoirse Noonan speaking to Sky Sports:

""We could have still won at the end but it was a great team effort. We could have snuck three points after that one.

""We could hear both fans and that is what football is about. They are both going at each other but it's a great game for women's football. It was another great test for us. We haven't lost yet.""

It's a quick turnaround before the next fixture for Potter's side with Rangers Women hosting Motherwell Women on Saturday.

Meanwhile, Celtic will have an extra two days of rest before their next game against FC Twente Women on in the Champions League on Tuesday.

Rory plays with PGA Tour and LIV chiefs amid Alfred Dunhill Links intrigue,"Golf

Celebrities from sport, TV and film join golf stars including Rory McIlroy, Jon Rahm and Matt Fitzpatrick in the pro-am event; McIlroy hopeful of PGA Tour-LIV deal ""before year's end""; watch Alfred Dunhill Links Championship live on Sky Sports Golf from 12pm on Thursday

Thursday 3 October 2024 18:17, UK

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player

Rory McIlroy will play rounds alongside the two central figures in the long-running talks between the PGA Tour and LIV Golf, while Gareth Bale and Jimmy Anderson feature in a star-studded celebrity field, for what is poised to be an intriguing week at the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship.

Live on Sky Sports Golf from Thursday, the tournament in Scotland features an individual event for the professionals - and a crucial one at that amid the closing weeks of the DP World Tour's Race to Dubai - and a team competition in which the pros are paired with amateurs in rounds across three famous links courses - St Andrews, Carnoustie and Kingsbarns - ahead of a final round at the Old Course for the top performers on Sunday.

And the announcement of the pro-am pairings and playing groups for the week has proved to be eye-catching.

Jay Monahan, the PGA Tour commissioner, and Yasir Al-Rumayyan, who is the governor of the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF) which bankrolls LIV, are both present in Scotland and will play in a group alongside each other and their respective professional player in Thursday's first round.

Teeing off at 9am from Carnoustie's 10th, Monahan is paired with American Billy Horschel for the week, while Al-Rumayyan is teaming up with LIV's Dean Burmester.

McIlroy, who is playing the tournament alongside his father Gerry, will then feature in the same group as Monahan on Friday and Al-Rumayyan on Saturday.

McIlroy was initially an arch-critic of the LIV Golf League when it launched in 2022 but admitted earlier this year that he had been ""too judgmental"" about those players who defected from the established tours, with the four-time major winner now keen to see a peace deal that moves golf forwards together amid continued talks over the framework agreement.

Speaking during a practice round at St Andrews on Wednesday, McIlroy told BBC Northern Ireland: ""It's a great thing and a good sign that Jay and Yasir are playing together on Thursday. I think it is a step in the right direction.

""Time will tell if things go in the direction I want them to or a lot of people want them to.

""I think we all understand it is not easy and, you know, change for the most part in golf is resisted because it is such a traditional sport. But I think at this point in time I think change is needed to sort of try and drive the game forward and hopefully we can get to that point.""

A hopeful McIlroy then predicted when asked when the negotiations might reach a conclusion: ""Definitely before the year's end.

""It's a pretty complicated deal, but I think we'll know more by the year's end hopefully.""

This week's tournament is the first of the DP World Tour season's crucial final four events before the end-of-season Play-Offs in the United Arab Emirates in November.

In addition to McIlroy, Tommy Fleetwood and defending champion Matt Fitzpatrick are in this week's field, as are 14 LIV-affiliated players - including Jon Rahm and Tyrrell Hatton, who play on the tour for the second successive week after their appeals against outstanding fines for defecting to the rival series over the past year.

Bale, the former Wales captain and Real Madrid forward who retired from professional football last year, makes his second appearance at the event in the pro-am.

Bale made his debut at the event in 2023 and underlined his golfing abilities in the first round by shooting a one-under-par 71 around the fearsome Carnoustie course.

This year Bale is paired with England's Daniel Brown, the 29-year-old ranked 167 in the world who made a spectacular entrance to major golf at Royal Troon in July when he surged into The Open lead at the end of the first round after a five-under 66 and ended up finishing tied 10th to cap an impressive week.

Paired together in the teams championship, Bale and Brown will first tackle St Andrews in Thursday's first round with a 11.01am tee time when they will play in a group with Marcus Armitage and singer Tom Chaplin from Keane.

On Friday, Bale's group includes Sky Sports pundit and fellow ex-footballer Jamie Redknapp when they will play Carnoustie from 9.55am, while on Saturday he will be part of the same four as Netherlands and AC Milan legend Ruud Gullit at Kingsbarns.

Meanwhile, England legend and fast bowler Jimmy Anderson makes his own second appearance at the event and is teamed up with countryman Sam Bairstow. The pair are the third group off at St Andrews on Thursday morning at 9.22am.

Other sports stars in action in the pro-am include Sir AP McCoy, Sir Ian Botham, Sir Steve Redgrave and Kelly Slater, while the world of film is represented by Michael Douglas, Bill Murray and Kathryn Newton.

McIlroy, chasing a first victory in the event, and his father Gerry tee off at 9.11am at Carnoustie on Thursday, while Matt Fitzpatrick is again teaming up with his mum, Sue, to defend both the individual and teams titles he won in 2023.

With the professionals and their amateur playing partners split across the three famous courses for the opening three days' play in Scotland, Sunday's concluding round is played at St Andrews with the field reduced to the top 60 pros, including ties, and the leading 20 teams.

The DP World Tour heads to Scotland next for the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship, where Rory McIlroy returns to action. Watch live on Thursday from midday on Sky Sports Golf. Stream the DP World Tour, PGA Tour and more with NOW.

The cameo that began Duran’s rise to ultimate super-sub,"Football

Jhon Duran's rise to reach Aston Villa started when he was spotted by Chicago Fire technical director Sebastian Pulzer playing for Envigado in his native Colombia as a 16-year-old; he lasted only one year in the MLS before the Premier League came calling

Digital Football Journalist
              @Ronnabe

Thursday 3 October 2024 17:30, UK

It says a lot that no one was surprised when Jhon Duran came off the bench, scored a stunning goal and delivered Aston Villa's biggest European result in a generation.

There was poetry in beating Bayern Munich, the same side they toppled to lift the European Cup 42 years ago. In a different way, it was poetic Duran should be the man to score the winner.

It was the 20-year-old's 14th goal for the club. He has still only made 11 starts. Duran's proficiency is such that his Premier League minutes-per-goal ratio can only be matched by Erling Haaland.

And still, he can't buy a start when Ollie Watkins is the man ahead of him.

He has unquestionably done enough to earn more than a solitary start against Wycombe Wanderers this season, but the Colombian is the master of his own downfall. He is just too good as a super-sub.

Of his 14 goals, 10 have come as a substitute. He is the ultimate bench player, already scoring winners against Everton, West Ham and now Bayern Munich this season. He played less than half an hour against each.

No one in Europe's top-five leagues has scored as many goals from the bench in 2024/25.

Perhaps the ultimate poetry is that just one substitute appearance more than four years ago, when Duran was just 16, was enough to begin his journey to England's top flight.

Former Blackburn defender Sebastian Pelzer, now Chicago Fire's technical director, was in the stands at Envigado, one of Colombia's top flight, to cast an eye over a young centre-back named Carlos Teran.

The defender made enough of an impression on the back of existing scouting reports that the club signed him a year later. But it was a late cameo from an unknown striker which really caught Pelzer's attention.

""From the moment he came on, you could see he was an interesting player,"" Pelzer told Sky Sports. ""He was already physically developed, but also had that movement, that acceleration.

""He had a certain maturity in his playing style, even from his young age. It was very impressive. If a 16-year-old comes on and stands out in such a short period of time, that moment was enough to be convinced.

""You have to have the imagination of what a player could be if they progress; I used my experience from playing in England to think, even then, he could be a Premier League player.""

Pelzer thought he had unearthed a hidden gem but two weeks later, Duran featured in The Guardian's 60 best young talents in world football, alongside Jamal Musiala and Xavi Simons. All of a sudden, everything changed.

""We had to really speed things up from then,"" Pelzer said. ""Now there were other teams in Europe interested in bringing him in, with a track record already.

""But we managed it well to get his signing over the line in the end.""

In January 2021, Fire signed Duran - but they could not add him to their roster until he turned 18 the following December, so he stayed with Envigado for another year.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player

Eager to still harness his young talent, Pelzer sanctioned individual coaching alongside his club commitments. He calls it a good investment - and it was one Fire would only make for a player they especially valued.

""We wanted to prepare him properly for the MLS. It's a physical league, the demands are different than in Colombia,"" Pelzer explained. ""The way he developed during that time was really impressive.

""You could see him getting better and better, and he had a willingness to progress. There was a diamond coming out, and when he arrived in Chicago he was in very good shape.""

Duran had become a man in age and stature. Head coach Ezra Hendrickson was impressed enough to hand him his MLS debut in Fire's first game of the 2022 season, a 0-0 draw at Inter Miami.

""My first impression was that we had a very, very talented player who could reach the highest level,"" Hendrickson told Sky Sports. ""He's a physical freak of nature; he's big, strong, fast and can finish.""

In maturity, there was still a way to go. As there would be for most young adults having their world uprooted weeks after their 18th birthday.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player

Duran's teenage temper got the better of him. He was booked seven minutes into his debut and again in his second game. It left Hendrickson wary of handing him a first start - and when he did, Duran picked up two yellows and was sent off.

Things could've turned sour as his temperament raised questions about whether he could be trusted.

Instead, Hendrickson put an arm around him. Fire's players were soon joking that they were father and son.

It was worth it - Fire were rewarded with eight goals and three assists in the rest of the season, almost the equivalent of a goal contribution every 90 minutes.

""Sometimes a culture shock can be too heavy for young players to adapt,"" Hendrickson said. ""It's a catch-22 sometimes with young players. You can see the talent, you want to get them on the pitch but immaturity ends up costing the team.

""Jhon could have started his first game for us about a month sooner than he did. He was like a son to me, his team-mates would call him that.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player

""I would bring him into the office often and talk about his inconsistencies in training - sometimes he wouldn't listen to anyone but me. I had to make sure that changed, because I wanted him to listen to the assistant coaches as well.

""He was a good kid, he just needed some direction and an authority figure to make sure he reached his potential.""

Pelzer and Hendrickson hoped unearthing Duran's potential would take long enough that they would at least have another year from their burgeoning talent.

But by the end of 2022, the widespread interest from across Europe made clear that wasn't going to happen.

Aston Villa pushed the hardest to sign him, and impressed both Duran and his agent with a seven-minute compilation of his best bits from Chicago and Colombia to convince him just how aware they were of his talents.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player

It has taken time for Duran to show signs that he does have that Premier League potential which originally drew in Pelzer. That temperament again threatened to derail his rise, with Unai Emery hinting at frustrations with his attitude in the early months of last season.

The protracted non-move to West Ham this summer, and the 'hammers' gesture on his social media interpreted as a mark of disrespect to Villa's fans, could have been the final straw.

But all has been forgiven after his recent run. There have been too many starring cameos for this to be just a purple patch.

""He was completely convinced to get here and stay here with us,"" Emery told Sky Sports recently. ""We are trying to get the best of him both as a person and a player. His potential is there.

""If you watch the matches he plays here, the goals he scores here, the process he is doing here, maybe you can think like me as well. His potential is a big potential.

""My responsibility, and my challenge, is to exploit it.""

Is the new Champions League format working?,"Football

The new Champions League format is now well under way - with plenty of talking points from the opening two gameweeks; Sky Sports football writers and pundits debate whether this new UEFA format is better than what was there before...

Thursday 3 October 2024 16:46, UK

The new Champions League format is now two gameweeks old - but has it been a success so far?

UEFA tore up the rulebook at the start of this season, ditching the traditional eight groups of four in the group stage with a new 'Swiss-style' 36-league format.

The top eight sides in the league will qualify automatically for the last 16, while the teams finishing in ninth to 24th place will compete in a two-legged play-off against each other to join the top eight teams in that round of the competition.

So is this new format working? Or are the old ways better than what is on offer? Several voices within Sky Sports debate this topic below...

Sky Sports' Paul Merson:

The Aston Villa-Bayern Munich result is why this tournament looks quite good at the moment because there's a lorry-load of games, so it doesn't really make a difference.

If you're Bayern Munich now and that result came in the old group stages, they would be thinking: 'we might come second in the group'. And if you come second in the group, then you're playing one of the big boys. So it does give you leeway.

Latest Champions League news

It also suits teams like Aston Villa. They would have probably come the old group stages as a No 3 or No 4 seed, they would have needed a couple of results like the one against Bayern Munich to have a chance of qualifying.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player

It also suits teams like Celtic. One week, they win by five, the next they're beaten by seven - but they're still in the tournament. This is where it works for those teams.

At the end of this league phase set-up, there are going to be teams who will need a win to get into the top eight, some teams will need a win to get into the top 24. So there's a lot of play for, so I like the way it is at the moment.

Sky Sports' Kris Boyd:

I quite enjoy the new format. A lot of people are moaning about it but the old one, you could probably pick the two teams that were going to go through.

Yes there was the shock here and there but you could clearly say: 'that team is going to drop into the Europa League' so I quite like this new format.

Sky Sports' Adam Bate:

The cachet of the Champions League is such that, instinctively, players want to play in it and coaches are inclined to name their strongest sides but one wonders whether this format will encourage the opposite given much of the jeopardy has been removed.

It might seem absurd to think that Pep Guardiola and Mikel Arteta can afford to lose more matches in an eight-game league than a 38-game one but that could well be the situation in which they already find themselves, knowing that eighth is the target.

Vincent Kompany on the omission of Jamal Musiala


""It has something to do with the last match [against Bayer Leverkusen]. We knew 90 minutes was too much for him, 45 might be okay, so we brought him on for the second half. The reason was a physical problem, but it shouldn’t be a problem for the next game.”

Being inside Villa Park for Aston Villa's win over Bayern Munich was a thrill but that felt like an outlier given the historic circumstances of the club's return to Europe's top table. The early exchanges have been marked instead by a series of mismatched encounters.

At least each one only happens once now, rather than home and away, adding more variety to the European schedule with eight different opponents rather than three, while it is too soon to say for certain how that final round of matches in January will shape up.

But the bigger picture here is that no amount of tinkering with the format will solve the challenges caused by such financial disparities. It is an issue within domestic leagues. In matches between teams from different leagues, it has become a little farcical.

Sky Sports' Ben Grounds:

There is nothing to like about the new format. Several players have spoken out about the increase in matches, with each team now playing eight games over 10 gameweeks.

Quite a few of them have coincidentally been ruled out since through injury, and the overall quality is already being compromised. PSG manager Luis Enrique was happy to field youthful team away to Arsenal, aware of the bigger picture.

UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin said ""the dream to participate will remain for all clubs"" - and yet having increased in size from 32 to 36, two of the additional four places are now being awarded on the performance of a country's clubs in Europe over the previous season.

But do those wishing to close the gap really gain anything from 7-1 trouncings? Where once we witnessed champions fighting it out in what wasn't a league, now we have a league with many sides who cannot claim to be champions, of anything, for decades.

What we have now, at best before Christmas, are exhibition encounters with very little jeopardy smattered by regular mismatches that only highlight the gulf in class even between Europe's best 36 clubs.

Sky Sports News' European football expert Dougie Critchley:

Has it worked? It's of course early days, but so far it hasn't really caught alight, with the gap between the best and the worst feeling larger than ever.

Of course this isn't anything new. Television broadcast deals within individual countries and the introduction of state-owned clubs in the last 15 years, have ensured the landscape has never been equal, but judging by the opening games, it's larger than ever.

We've already seen the German champions Bayer Leverkusen dispatch Feyenoord, Dutch champions just 18 months ago, 4-0 at their own stadium. Bayern Munich became the first side to score nine goals since the competition's rebrand 32 years ago as they thrashed Dinamo Zagreb. While on the first matchday of week two we saw three 4-0 results, a 5-0 and a 7-1.

Villa beating Bayern is an example of a shock. But more importantly, we don't know whether all this matters.

With six more rounds of fixtures, will Celtic's 7-1 defeat really matter when they still have the opportunity to pick up points against Dinamo Zagreb, Club Brugge and Young Boys?

The making of 'maverick' Morgan Rogers,"Football

Morgan Rogers has started every Premier League and Champions League game for Aston Villa this season; the 22-year-old is in the form of his life with and without the ball; watch Aston Villa vs Man Utd live on Sky Sports this Sunday from 1pm; kick-off 2pm

@SamBIitz

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player

Twelve months ago, Morgan Rogers was a squad player for Middlesbrough. Fast forward 12 months, the forward - now at Aston Villa - is in the form of his life.

In the last two weeks alone, he has made his Champions League debut against Young Boys, produced two assists in a 3-1 comeback win over Wolves, got his first Premier League goal of the season at Ipswich and then played 90 minutes in a historic European win over Bayern Munich.

In fact, Rogers has started every single Premier League and Champions League match under Unai Emery this season. He has become as ever-present Emiliano Martinez at one end of the pitch and Ollie Watkins at the other. Some Villa fans even claim he has been the club's best player this season.

After all, Rogers is easy on the eye in this Villa team, mainly due to his work rate with and without the ball. His sheer strength and drive in terms of running ability has gained plenty of plaudits this season.

Rogers ranks highly among Premier League players when it comes to carrying the ball great distances, taking Emery's Villa higher up the pitch and into more dangerous areas.

These skills were best seen when Rogers put in an impressive display against Arsenal in the second game of this season. Footage showed the normally defensively resolute Thomas Partey and Declan Rice falling at the feet of the Villa forward.

""The way he was brushing people away, it was like watching Jonah Lomu,"" said Jamie Redknapp that day.

These skills were first noticed when Rogers was just four years old, when the now-Villa star was first spotted - somewhat ironically - by a former Birmingham City player.

Accompanied by his father Howar, the toddler was taken to a training session in the Midlands town of Halesowen run by ex-Blues midfielder Paul Tait, who made 140 appearances for the blue side of Birmingham.

""As soon as I saw him, you just know that this particular child has just got something different,"" Tait tells Sky Sports. ""He was just different from the rest, a fantastic little player, way beyond his years from a very, very young age.

""He was playing in his own age group to start with, but it was ridiculous, he was getting nothing from it. We would play small-sided games to get the kids to score goals - and you just couldn't get the ball off him.

""I started to move him up to play against the bigger children - so when he was five or six, I was playing him against 10 or 11-year-olds. It sounds like a dumb thing, but I wanted to see how he'd get on. And he tore them to shreds.""

Tait was so impressed that he offered Rogers to West Brom's academy - the Rogers family are all die-hard Baggies fans. ""Even though I'm a Birmingham supporter, at the time I thought West Brom would look after players better,"" Tait adds.

""They had one look at him and couldn't believe how good he was. They were going: 'Oh my God, how do we stop him going to Villa? They seem to snap up everyone in this area.'

""But he stuck with it, he stuck with the belief that West Brom would be best for his development in his early future in football.""

Rogers stayed with boyhood club West Brom - going on to make one FA Cup appearance for the club in 2019 - but was then pinched by Manchester City after starring in the Baggies' FA Youth Cup run to the semi-finals.

Rogers' strength, frame and power also stood out in one of the best academies in the world, which normally produce a different type of footballer.

""I always felt he was a little bit different to the players in the Man City system. He's a maverick,"" says Brian Barry-Murphy, City's former Elite Development Squad coach.

""He's definitely different because he can get the ball and run really quickly, directly and carry the ball big distances.

""That is what set him aside from the rest of the players who had come through the Man City system from a very young age - who were a lot of technical players who could play in tight spaces and play combination passes.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player

""Morgan has the ability to receive, turn and run with the ball and really affect opponents. How he moves is really efficient and his size is under-estimated.

""He's always been big for his age, but now among senior professionals he looks big. That ability to create and score goals with those attributes was always a standout.""

Part of his development at City was through a 'loan map' in the EFL. It started out at Lincoln, where he worked under Michael Appleton and played in an attack which also included on-loan Nottingham Forest winger Brennan Johnson. Rogers scored six times on the way to taking the Imps to the play-off final, where they lost to Blackpool at Wembley.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player

""We were not the biggest team and I remember there were a couple of games where we were thinking about the opposition and who to pick up,"" Appleton tells Sky Sports.

""And he just said, 'Put me on their biggest player. I will do the job.' He genuinely meant it. He had so much belief.

""He actually likes the contact. He enjoys people being really tight to him and he can then use his physical frame to roll them on the inside or the outside.""

But not all the loan spells were successful. In fact, Lincoln was the best in terms of output for Rogers.

His next move was a loan to Championship promotion Bournemouth, where Rogers rarely played under Scott Parker in the 2021-22 season.

In a recent interview, Rogers admitted to experiencing loneliness at the south coast club - which is unlike him as coaches describe him as an ""outgoing character"" - and his season-long loan move was cut short halfway through.

He went back to City until the end of 2022 and then had another go at the Championship with Blackpool to reunite with Appleton, who was sacked two weeks after Rogers joined. It was not until his permanent move to Middlesbrough, which sparked a £15m switch to Aston Villa within six months, where Rogers got back to playing at his potential.

""Seeing Morgan doing what he's doing, it's hard to believe it. I always thought he would do really well, but he really struggled at Bournemouth, really struggled at Blackpool and at Middlesbrough he did ok,"" says Barry-Murphy.

""But there was always this feeling of: 'he's a lot better than what he's showing'. Now you're actually seeing that potential, so it shows you have to be patient.""

What also stands out with Rogers in Villa colours is his work off the ball to accompany the tenacity he possesses in possession.

The youngster is in the top 10 Premier League players for pressures this season and sits in the top percentiles for off-the-ball intensity.

""He has the ability to run with the ball but he also has that capacity to be extremely disruptive and dynamic out of possession, which is what you're seeing him flourish under Unai Emery now,"" says Barry-Murphy.

""From my experience, a lot of the players in the Man City academy dominate the ball every single game. So the defensive side needs a lot of work based on how little practice they have of it.

""He showed he had the physical capacity to excel at that. And it was always going to be a case of finding the right coach for him and finding the right set of circumstances to display that. And now you're seeing that.""

But there are, of course, areas for improvement. While he is excellent statistically, the numbers that matter could come across as a little dry for Rogers. After all, he has goal contributions in just two out of his eight Villa appearances this season.

""I believe he has this unique ability to arrive into the final situation more than any other player based on what he could do physically - but I felt his finishing was inconsistent, like any young player,"" says Barry-Murphy.

""He can score some amazing goals and be spectacular, but consistency in those finishing actions isn't at the same level as his build-up work.

""And I hope and imagine the same things now will be in his mind: that he's creating all these assists for other players and he's arriving in situations where he can score goals, but working on that finishing action will start to add another dimension in his game.""

That being said, Rogers is not the finished product. He is currently the England Under-21s key player, meaning a senior Three Lions call-up is surely not too far away either.

Up next is the visit of Manchester United to Villa Park. Given Arsenal and Bayern Munich have struggled to contain this 22-year-old, Erik ten Hag may have another problem on his hands.

Powerful explosions near Beirut airport; '18 dead' in West Bank strike; IDF says Hamas commander among those killed,"Eighteen people have been killed in an Israeli strike in the West Bank, according to the Palestinian health ministry. Israel says it has killed a Hezbollah commander responsible for July's deadly strike on a Golan Heights football pitch.

A pro-Palestine group in Sydney will be allowed to proceed with their protest rally on Sunday after police tried to get it called off.

Law enforcement asked the Supreme Court of New South Wales to block planned demonstrations this weekend, citing safety concerns.

Their petition was dismissed by consent after organisers agreed to change the location and route of the protest and not display flags, portraits, or symbols of prohibited organisations.

The Palestine Action Group Sydney also withdrew its request to protest on 7 Oct, the first anniversary of the terror attack from Hamas that sparked war in the Middle East.

Police said in a statement they would work with organisers to ensure the safety of the community and would not ""hesitate to take appropriate action against anyone who commits a criminal offence.""

Protests in Melbourne last weekend saw some participants waving Hezbollah flags and carrying pictures of its former leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in Israeli strikes.

Sweden's security service says Iran may have been behind the gunfire and explosions that took place near the Israeli embassies in Stockholm and Copenhagen this week.

Shots were fired at the Israeli embassy in Stockholm on Monday, while two explosions were reported near the Israeli embassy i Copenhagen on Wednesday morning.

Nobody was injured, and two Swedish teenagers were arrested and charged with possessing hand grenades and detonating them near the embassy.

Fredrik Hallstrom, from Sweden's security service Sapo, said the choice of targets and methods pointed in the direction of Iran, but added this was an ""assumption rather than pure knowledge"".

Danish police have not confirmed whether the Israeli embassy was the target of the explosions. There are other embassies close to where the blasts were heard.

With the crisis in the Middle East appearing to escalate, what are the implications for the Russia-Ukraine war?

Sky's military analyst Sean Bell breaks down how a face-off between Iran and Israel could have weapons-supply ramifications for both Russia and Ukraine.

US President Joe Biden says he believes an all-out war in the Middle East can be avoided.

Mr Biden made the comments on the White House lawn following a trip to visit areas damaged by Hurricane Helene.

Asked how confident he was that there wouldn't be a regional war, he said: ""How confident are you it's not going to rain?

""Look. I don't believe there's going to be an all-out war. I think we can avoid it. But there's a lot to do yet. A lot to do yet.""

Mr Biden was also asked why he had not spoken to Benjamin Netanyahu in recent days, after he said he would do on Sunday.

He said: ""Because there's no action going on right now.""

At least 18 Palestinians have died in an Israeli airstrike in the West Bank city of Tulkarm, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.

The Israeli military earlier said that it had conducted a strike on Tulkarm which killed the head of the Hamas network in the city.

It said Zahi Yaser Abd al-Razeq Oufi supplied weapons to terrorists in the West Bank area and was planning to execute a terror attack in the ""immediate"" future.

The IDF added that ""multiple other significant terrorists"" were eliminated in the strike.

In a post on X, Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa called the attack a ""massacre"" and said Israel is ""ignoring global calls for justice"".

The head of the World Health Organisation (WHO) has called for urgent help to bring medical supplies into Lebanon.

The country is currently engulfed in a humanitarian crisis due to ongoing hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah.

Medical officials have reported hospitals across the country being overwhelmed with injured people due to the violence.

Posting on X, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has called for the ""urgent facilitation of flights to deliver health supplies"".

He says the problem has been exacerbated due to the ""almost complete closure of Beirut's airport"".

There were reports that one of the Israeli strikes targeting Beirut in the past hours hit close to Beirut's airport.

Joe Biden says he won't negotiate in public when asked if he had urged Israel not to attack Iran's oil facilities.

Israel is said to be deciding how it will retaliate to the missile attack launched against it by Tehran on Tuesday.

Mr Biden has already said publicly he advises against Israel targeting Iran's nuclear facilities in its response.

Asked by reporters whether he would urge Israel not to go after Iran's oil as well, he said: ""I know not to negotiate in public.""

The UN Security Council has given its full support for Antonio Guterres after Israel banned the UN secretary general from entering the country.

Israel's foreign minister said on Wednesday that Mr Guterres is not welcome in the country, accusing him of being biased against Israel.

In a joint statement released tonight, the 15-member council ""underscored that any decision not to engage with the UN secretary general or the United Nations is counterproductive, especially in the context of escalating tensions in the Middle East.""

The members also urged countries to ""refrain from any actions that undermine his work"".

As we've been reporting in the last hour, there's been more strikes in Beirut tonight.

The majority have focused on the southern suburbs of the city, which has been the main target of Israel's bombings of the Lebanese capital.

Lebanon's health ministry says 37 people have been killed and 151 wounded by Israeli strikes across the country in the last 24 hours.

Watch the video below to see and hear the blasts rock Beirut.

The Israeli military says it killed the head of the Hamas network in the Palestinian city of Tulkarm with an airstrike today.

It said Zahi Yaser Abd al-Razeq Oufi supplied weapons to terrorists in the West Bank area and was planning to execute a terror attack in the ""immediate"" future.

""Furthermore, Oufi took part in the planning and executing of numerous significant and extreme terror attacks against Israeli civilians in Judea and Samaria, including attacks that led to the injury of additional Israeli civilians,"" it added.

The IDF also said it eliminated ""multiple other significant terrorists"" with the strike.

Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says the attack killed at least 18 people and that the site that was hit was a refugee camp."

Multiple ambulances destroyed, stations hit, Civil Defence crews killed... emergency workers in Lebanon say they're suffering a sustained attack on them by Israeli forces.

""We are definitely coming under specific attack,"" Sayyed Abdullah, head of Civil Defence in the south, told a group of mainly foreign media.

""We have had 40 ambulances which have been completely destroyed,"" he said, adding: ""On top of that 24 rescuing stations have been hit - just in this area.

Israel-Iran latest: Powerful explosions near Beirut airport

""They were all targeted directly and I'm just speaking about our organisation.""

A number of his colleagues, young and old, echoed that belief.

One Civil Defence worker who's been part of the emergency crew for 20 years told us how earlier in the day, a team of his colleagues had raced to a bomb site to help the injured.

""The first team went to rescue them and they were hit. Another team went to rescue them, they were also hit,"" he said.

""At the end the Red Cross went to rescue them and they too were attacked.""

His 20-year-old young co-worker Yasser told us he would not be intimidated into leaving: ""We will not leave. If we leave, who will look after the people?""

Several Civil Defence crews have been killed - seven in one hit in Beirut. Their colleagues and friends need no more convincing their lives are at risk.

The airstrikes and casualties are on a daily basis in this area of southern Lebanon.

The thud of bombs landing are a regular frightening noise here now. But with doctors and nurses too feeling they are being targeted, it seems it's becoming more and more risky to be an emergency worker in Lebanon.

""There are international laws protecting doctors all over the world,"" Dr Hussam Telleih, one young doctor told us, adding: ""But not in Lebanon.

""There are no Hezbollah weapons in this hospital. You can see for yourself. You've been all over the hospital. We completely deny this.""

""They are trying to do here what they did in Gaza. They said the same about al Shifa hospital in Gaza, calling it a Hamas control centre. We feel we are next.""

As we are at the latest bomb site where the Civil Defence teams are working, an alarm goes up and we're told to evacuate.

The crews are nervous. There's a group of them in one place to talk to the assembled media and they're worried that this number of vehicles all together might draw the attention of the 'eyes in the skies' - the Israeli drones which also constantly circle above.

We reached out to the Israeli Defence Forces media office for comment on these accusations, but we received no reply.

When we move to another site in Tyre city, a young man is hobbling on a crutch near another crushed building.

He tells us about what appears to be a miraculous escape from death. An airstrike has caused two buildings to collapse, killing a family of five. Three women, including a teenager, a grandfather and a two-year-old baby have died.

The young man was in the neighbouring house but tells us he was trapped for several hours before rescue workers pulled him out of the rubble barely conscious.

""It's lies,"" he says, referring to the Israeli claim that every house hit contains Hezbollah weapons, a fighter or commander. ""This is all lies. We are civilians and my uncle was killed and he wasn't doing anything.""

We see, far off in the distance, dozens of volleys of rockets being fired off one after another.

We've stopped to try to find a mechanic who can help repair our vehicle's punctured tyre, and a small group has gathered to watch the rockets shooting off. There are appreciative noises and a frisson of excitement among the group as the blasts arc across the skyline.

But the far more constant thunderous drum is the crashing thud and boom of Israeli missiles landing.

And that doesn't seem likely to ease any time soon.

'We're nothing to them': Residents' fury at 'woeful' response to fire that nearly killed them,"One woman calls the response since the fire ""an insult"" that's compounded their trauma, while the council leader says more power is needed to hold building owners and managing firms to account.

National correspondent
              @TomSkyNews

Friday 4 October 2024 02:10, UK

Residents who escaped a fire in a ""deathtrap"" block of flats have told Sky News they feel abandoned after both the management firm and owner of the building have failed to meet them.

The response has been branded ""woeful"" by the local council - who have had to pay £500,000 to support residents who have lost everything.

It's been five weeks since people ran for their lives in the early hours after fire ripped through the privately owned Spectrum Building in east London during works to remove dangerous cladding.

Residents said fire alarms failed to sound and an escape route was padlocked, which meant some had to climb fences to flee.

""They don't care… we are nothing to them,"" said Kasia Stantke as we sat in her budget hotel room next to a busy dual carriageway where she's been living for most of the past five weeks.

""We are worthless [to them], why would they not meet us?"" she asked.

The 43-year-old management accountant describes the building that she, and 80 other residents, called home as a ""death trap"".

She was horrified to learn various works to address fire safety problems had been ongoing for the past four years.

""The people responsible should be prosecuted, if guilty they should go to jail,"" said Kasia.

Other residents have told Sky News they too feel abandoned.

Some are tenants who were renting their flats, others own the leases of their properties.

The freeholder - who owns the building - employed a firm called Block Management to manage the communal areas.

One woman described the response since the fire as ""an insult"" that has compounded the trauma of that night.

A children's nursery on the ground floor has also had to move to a new temporary home.

Sky News tracked down the director of Block Management, who reluctantly agreed to speak to us near their headquarters in Suffolk.

David Collinson acknowledged the situation residents have been left in is ""absolutely awful"".

However, he rejects the council's claim that his company should have led on support for residents.

""I'm very sorry we don't have that legal obligation,"" he said.

""We are employed as a block manager to manage the common parts of the property, not the leasehold flats and not the tenants.

""We don't have a contract with them. Obviously, we're massively sympathetic. And if I could wave a magic wand to help them out, I promise you, you know, that's exactly what we would do.""

""I would love to go meet with the residents, but I haven't,"" he added. ""We physically haven't got anything tangible to say to the residents.""

We asked if he was aware of the history of fire safety problems in the block.

He said: ""There's been various projects over probably the last 48 months of fire remediation works. And to the best of our knowledge, everything was done as it should be.""

""The freeholder has the ultimate responsibility. It's his building,"" Mr Collinson added.

'Attitude needs to change'

Sky News has tried repeatedly to reach Brijesh Patel, the director of Arinium, the listed freeholder, but he has not responded to calls or messages.

The local authority has had to step in with emergency help and accommodation for residents and has so far spent over £500,000.

The leader of the council told Sky News the management company's remote communications have been unacceptable given the circumstances.

""Contacting remotely from an office? It's woeful, isn't it?"" Councillor Dominic Twomey told Sky News.

""If Block Management are symptomatic, and I'm hopeful they're not, of management companies, then I think that attitude needs to change.""

""Just go and talk to people,"" he pleaded.

After the fire, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner visited the Spectrum building and promised to make sure residents were supported.

She also vowed to accelerate the remediation works to remove dangerous cladding on residential blocks around the country.

Cllr Twomey added: ""It has to be a national change... more teeth for local authorities like us.

""Because if we had more powers to speak to and tackle freeholders or block management companies, if we could actually make them come to the table and engage, that would just be a step in the right direction.""

The fire, which broke out on 26 August, is still under investigation by the Metropolitan Police, London Fire Brigade and the Health and Safety Executive.

More immediately for Kasia, the erection of scaffolding outside her budget hotel room has brought the memories of that night flooding back.

""I'm scared now again, I'm really hoping it will be a week or so and I will be able to move on,"" she said.

""But for now, another scaffolding outside my window.""

""Am I again trapped? What's going to happen now? I can't believe it, it's a living nightmare, absolutely,"" she added."

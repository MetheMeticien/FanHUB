MLB,"Welcome to ESPN India Edition
NEW YORK -- TheNew York Yankeesepitomize big. The brand, the payroll, the expectations, the excitement, the disappointment. It is an appropriate bit of casting that the largest star in baseball history,Aaron Judge, wears pinstripes. He is the physical embodiment of the Yankees franchise: too big to keep failing.
For the past 14 years, the Yankees have not functioned as the perpetual conquerors who have won more World Series titles than any franchise. They entered this postseason having lost 10 of their past 18 playoff series. They have fallen in their past five American League Championship Series appearances. The most recognizable franchise in baseball, whose caps are worn around the world, has been rendered just another team.
With Game 3 of the ALCS against theCleveland Guardiansset for 5:08 p.m. ET on Thursday, the Yankees can taste their first World Series appearance since 2009, when they won their 27th championship. Their 6-3 win in Game 2 was New York's fifth in six postseason games, giving them a 2-0 series lead on the Guardians.
Now is the time for them to deliver. Everything has lined up for the Yankees. They won the AL East. Their greatest tormentors, theHouston Astros, were knocked out in the first round, unable to wreck more Yankees dreams. They dispatched the peskyKansas City Royalsin the division series. And not much looks as if it will change in the ALCS. Among the five wild pitches in Game 1, the shoddy defense in Game 2 and the flaccid bats in both, the Guardians haven't looked up to the task of beating a Yankees team that has found its groove in October.
For large chunks of the season, this team looked like a threat to win its 28th World Series. In the playoffs, New York has preyed on a pair of AL Central teams to reinforce they are the best the league has to offer. The Yankees this postseason have walked 37 times and struck out 44 times in six games. They feature a lineup whose Nos. 7-9 hitters in Game 2 went 5-for-10 and scored three runs. Their leadoff hitters have been on base in 25 of the 51 innings they've played in October. Their bullpen ERA is 0.77 over 23⅓ innings. They've given up only three stolen bases.
The only thing missing for New York had been Judge, whose failures in past Octobers -- a career .769 OPS in the postseason compared to 1.010 in the regular season -- are the lone ding on a pristine résumé. If he begins to perform like his MVP self -- and perhaps he started something Tuesday with his first home run this October -- Yankees third basemanJazz Chisholm Jr. predicted nothing short of a gilded future.
""We're World Series champions. No other doubt in my mind,"" Chisholm said. ""I've been saying it from day one, and that's without him raking. He's starting to come together. And now I see it.""
This has been the plan all along. They spent $360 million to re-sign Judge and gave up a boatload of talent to acquire Soto. They stuck with manager Aaron Boone and have seen him work wonders with a questionable bullpen. The Yankees are carrying themselves the way they haven't in years -- with a strut, a we're-good-and-we-know-it attitude. Championship No. 28 is within reach. And now is the moment -- first against the Guardians, then whoever wins the dogfight between theLos Angeles DodgersandNew York Mets-- for 14 years of letdowns to give way and let the Yankees earn what they believe is theirs.
LAST WEEK INKansas City, as the champagne celebration raged inside the Yankees' clubhouse after their division series, one person remained in the dugout. Judge was missing the tail end of the revelry, by choice, because through the bowels of the stadium walked the players' families, ready to celebrate themselves on the Kauffman Stadium field.
This is what Judge does, and this is who he is. Family matters as much as his teammates, and he wanted them to know that. Even as his struggles at the plate mounted, Judge hadn't lost sight of who he is, what he means and why he is the face of the Yankees.

It was simultaneously gratifying and frightening, then, to see what happened in the seventh inning of Game 2 on Tuesday night. Cleveland'sHunter Gaddis, one of the best relief pitchers in baseball this season, delivered a 95 mph fastball in a great location -- the tippy-top of the strike zone, between the belt and the letters even on the 6-foot-7 Judge. It was the sort of pitch Judge saw dozens of times this season and batted .095 against.
He suffered no such frailties Tuesday. Even in the cold autumn air of Yankee Stadium, with the wind conspiring to knock down the ball, it kept flying, 414 feet, over the center-field fence, prompting paroxysms of joy among the 47,054 fans who witnessed Judge's first major moment of this postseason.
The gratification comes from the Yankees' immense respect for Judge -- how much he cares and how he carried the team for months and how he holds people accountable without making them feel as if they're being held accountable. As great of a player as Judge is, he is regarded as a similarly gifted leader, and to see their captain not performing to his capabilities vexed Yankees players. He had struggled for only 15 at-bats -- nothing in a normal stretch, everything in October. Which is what made Judge showing signs of life frightening as well: If the Yankees were rolling through the postseason before Judge found his swing, imagine what they'll look like if the home run off Gaddis portends more. Especially if the hitter in front of him keeps getting on base.
EVERYTHING THE YANKEESenvisioned when they traded forJuan Sotolast offseason has become a reality. Rare is the deal with outsize expectations that are actually met, and yet here is the 25-year-old Soto, in the midst of another postseason run, able to relish it far more than he did the first time.
Soto was 20 when theWashington Nationalswon the World Series in 2019. He burst on the scene a year earlier, a 19-year-old wunderkind with the best eye since Barry Bonds and preternatural power who shot balls over the fence to all fields. Winning a championship only a year later spoiled Soto.
So he's relishing this -- the opportunity to make history with a franchise where history matters more than anywhere. The trade for Soto cost the Yankees dearly in talent. Not only did they give upMichael King, who threw 173⅔ innings of 2.95 ERA ball this season, but four other players as well. All for one season of Soto.
New York knew he would be headed for free agency this winter, and that didn't stop general manager Brian Cashman from ponying up a gargantuan package. The pressure on Cashman and Boone, vise-like in a normal year, had tightened after they went 82-80 in 2023. The previous six seasons had ended in postseason losses, but at least they ended in the postseason. This was beyond the pale: fourth place and 19 games behind an AL East-winning Baltimore team with an Opening Day payroll $217 million lower than the Yankees' $277 million.
Acquiring one of baseball's finest hitters solved plenty, and the evidence revealed itself early. Soto drove in runs in each of the Yankees' first four games this season, a sweep at Houston. He proceeded to hit a career-high 41 home runs, lead the AL with 128 runs scored and get on base in 138 of the 157 games he played. And he has been magnificent this postseason, leading the Yankees with seven hits, walking as much as he has struck out and further distinguishing himself as a unique offensive presence.
A player of Soto's talent with hunger for the moment is about as good as it gets in the sport, and the seamlessness of his transition to New York only heightens what's ahead of him. Soto's free agency is primed to be a frenzy: He is a $500 million-plus player, and another World Series appearance would not only validate his rightful place as one of the highest-paid athletes in history, it would reinforce just how properly this Yankees team was constructed.
HAL STEINBRENNER ISnot his father. George, who bought the Yankees in 1973, won back-to-back World Series in 1977 and 1978, oversaw the four-titles-in-five-years dynasty from 1996 to 2000 and captured his final championship in 2009, a year before his death. The Yankees' championship-or-bust standard is a George Steinbrenner creation that Hal inherited and can't disavow.
Nor does he want to. As the Yankees barge toward a World Series berth, it's worth remembering Steinbrenner has continued to spend money befitting the Yankees. It's never as much as fans in New York desire, but their $296.6 million Opening Day payroll this season ranked second in MLB. Their payroll ranks the nine years prior: 2, 3, 2, 1, 3, 6, 4, 2, 2.
A dominant pen has led Cleveland to a showdown with the Yankees -- but can it power it to a World Series title?David Schoenfield (ESPN+)
What's most important -- and where Cashman deserves credit -- is that the players receiving the majority of that money have played central roles this postseason.Gerrit Cole($324 million) pitched like an ace to clinch the division series.Carlos Rodon($162 million) threw six brilliant innings in Game 1 of the ALCS, using his slider for strikeouts and inducing swings and misses on three of his four changeups. Judge is about to win his second MVP in three seasons and carried the Yankees through 162 games. Soto is Soto.
Best of all isGiancarlo Stanton, the 34-year-old slugger whose seven seasons in New York have been as much about the time he hasn't spent on the field as the time he has. Trading for Stanton, who had nearly $300 million remaining on the final 10 years of his deal, was a risk.
Well, that's the purpose of a giant payroll: it allows for moon shots. New York figured it was buying the best of Stanton for the first half of his time in pinstripes. The fact he has performed this October like a prime version of himself, with a 1.037 OPS and two home runs, is a reminder the Yankees do have an advantage and it is well within their rights to use it, just as the Mets and Dodgers have.
It also illustrates the biggest difference between the Yankees of past and present. Under George Steinbrenner, Stanton would almost certainly be wearing a different uniform. With Hal, patience is a virtue in which he truly believes. If he didn't, the man running the team from the dugout almost certainly wouldn't be there, either.
AARON BOONE ISa very good Major League Baseball manager. This sort of statement angers a fair number of Yankees fans, but it is objectively true. Boone has the deep respect of players, he fights when it's needed, he manages stars exceptionally, he's strategically sound a vast majority of the time, he's conscious of history and he's good with the media. The Yankees job is the most scrutinized in baseball, and he does pretty much every part of it well.
This postseason has been Boone's playground. It has been only six games, so there is plenty of time for him to push a button that detonates a game, but his tactical acumen has been exceptional. Three times already he has turned toLuke Weaver-- his innings-eating-long-man-turned-closer -- in the eighth inning of playoff games. And he has been rewarded with a four-out save and a pair of five-out saves.
Yes, it's the sort of thing more and more managers are doing. But it speaks to Boone's understanding of leverage. Sometimes the biggest outs in a game come in the eighth inning, and if you're gifted a closer who can cover multiple innings and go multiple days in a row, use him and use him plenty.
And the presence of Weaver does feel like a gift. The Yankees are the 31-year-old's sixth major league team. He arrived in the big leagues in 2016 as a 92-mph-throwing starter. He went to Arizona in a trade, stumbled there, wasn't any better in Kansas City, scuffled with Cincinnati and Seattle last year and wound up making three starts for the Yankees at the end of their dismal 2023. New York brought him back on a one-year, $2 million contract, and it wound up as one of the best deals of the winter.
The Yankees' bullpen looked like a mess in early September. Boone finally tired ofClay Holmes' blown saves and removed him from the closer role. The only pitcher New York acquired at the trade deadline, Mark Leiter Jr., flopped and didn't crack the Yankees' ALDS or ALCS rosters. Boone wasn't comfortable withJake Cousins(too many walks) orTim Hill(too few strikeouts). He trustsTommy Kahnle, but in 221 career games with the Yankees, he has only four saves, an indication of New York's reticence to throw him in the ninth.
The job went to Weaver almost by default, and all he has done since is get hitters out. Since his first save Sept. 6, Weaver has thrown 18 innings, given up seven hits, walked four and struck out 33. His ERA is 0.50. He is not Mariano Rivera, but he's doing one hell of an impersonation. And along the way, Holmes has righted himself: 14⅔ innings, nine hits, five walks, 13 strikeouts and 1.23 ERA -- with nary a run scored in 6⅔ postseason innings.
Every championship team has its surprises, and the Yankees' bullpen turning into a weapon -- in similar fashion toJose LeclercandJosh Sborzhaving the October of their lives with Texas last season -- qualifies. Yankees relievers have been so good that it might make a regular observer of baseball wonder: Can they really keep it up?
NOW THAT THEYankees find themselves here, two wins from the World Series, six victories from a parade down New York's Canyon of Heroes. And with their path to a title as favorable as they've had in years, it's incumbent on them to finish the job. Beating a pair of AL Central teams is one thing. Doing it against a National League team that survived the gauntlet of the far better league will require something different altogether.
Sure, Judge hit a home run -- but his previous 26 plate appearances left plenty to be desired. Weaver and Holmes have been the best relief duo this postseason -- but Boone's reliance on them surely has an expiration date, and pitching both in each of New York's six playoff games runs the risk of overexposure, regardless of how good their stuff looks. The Yankees have won tight, hard-fought games. Their victories against Kansas City came by one, one and two runs, and their two wins against Cleveland are by three runs apiece. Despite being gifted a dropped pop-up and bobble in right field by the Guardians, New York needed Judge's home run to provide a decent cushion in Game 2.

Carrying a 2-0 series lead into Cleveland helps allay fears. There will be at least one more game played at Yankee Stadium this year, and the Guardians see Game 3 as a must-win. Teams that start a seven-game league championship series with a pair of wins are 32-5. Only once has a team fought from a 3-0 deficit to take an LCS.
And that, of course, was theBoston Red Sox's famous comeback against the Yankees in 2004. Cleveland will be hard-pressed to find the same sort of magic against this Yankees team. They'll need to beatClarke Schmidt, who, when healthy, was a nightmare for opposing hitters. Particularly terrifying for Cleveland is that against the Guardians' mostly left-handed lineup, Schmidt, who ditched his changeup this season, will rely heavily on his cutter to saw off Guardians hitters. And no team in MLB this year had a lower OPS on cutters thrown by right-handed pitchers than the Guardians' .653.
Schmidt is the Yankees' No. 3 starter, and he finished the season with a 2.85 ERA. It's just another sign that for all the lamenting that New York was simply a two-man team with Judge and Soto, that was never true. There is substance to these Yankees. They're not here just to do something. They're here to do something big, the only way they know how."

Emile Smith Rowe: I had to leave Arsenal for happiness,"Welcome to ESPN India Edition
Fulham'sEmile Smith Rowehas said his move fromArsenalwas the ""toughest decision"" of his career but one that was necessary for his happiness.
Smith Rowe left Arsenal for the west London club in the summer transfer window for aclub-record feeof £34 million ($44.1m).
The 24-year-old was a graduate of Arsenal's Hale End academy alongside teammateBukayo Sakaand made hisPremier Leaguedebut in the 2021-22 season, but struggled for minutes in the past two seasons.
""I can't remember an actual, exact moment,"" Smith Rowe said. ""But for the last two seasons I haven't played as much as I wanted to and it was always in the back of my mind that I wanted to be happy again.
""I wanted to be playing. Sometimes you have to think of the best for yourself. I always want to put my club first but at the same time I have to make myself happy. It was probably the toughest decision I've had to make [to leave]. But I spoke to my family and we decided it was the best thing for me.""
TheEnglandinternational struggled with injuries after initially bursting to prominence with the Arsenal first team.
""[It's] Really difficult. Definitely,"" he said when asked by the Telegraph about dealing with fitness setbacks. ""Ups and downs with injuries and then getting back fit and then not getting the opportunities that I obviously wanted.
""But at the same time Arsenal were pushing to win the league. So I had to wait and be patient. It was really tough. My family were there for me and I tried to stay as positive as I could. But it's football and these things happen.
""Coming through the academy all you want to do is just play for your club and when you are not getting the opportunities there is only so much you can take. Like I said there is no bad feelings or anything. I am still supporting them, I still talk to a few of the boys. It's all love.""
After not scoring for Arsenal since April 2022, Smith Rowe kickstarted his Fulham career with two goals and an assist in his first seven games.
""It was a relief,"" he said of finding the back of the net again. ""Just because I haven't had a feeling like in a long time.
""It's hard to explain the feeling. Just knowing that you have scored the goal and everyone is looking at you. I have really missed that feeling. It's literally addictive. You want to know what it's like tomorrow and the next day."""
Lucas Paquetá requests FA probe into alleged betting leaks,"Welcome to ESPN India Edition
West HammidfielderLucas Paquetáhas asked the English Football Association (FA) to investigate how information from its case against him over alleged breaches of betting rules has been leaked to the media.
Paquetá was charged in Maywith deliberately seeking to receive a booking during fourPremier Leaguegames in 2022 and 2023 in order for one or more persons to profit from betting.
The 27-year-old Brazilian denies the charges against him.
""I am frustrated and upset to have read recent misleading and inaccurate press articles, published in both England and Brazil, claiming to disclose information about my case,"" Paquetá said in astatement posted on social media.
""I am also concerned that, although they are false and misleading, these articles are clearly sourced from an individual close to the case. The FA proceedings are supposed to be confidential.
""I have, therefore, instructed my lawyers to write to the FA to request that they conduct a thorough investigation into how information about the case, even if inaccurate, is finding its way into the public domain."""
"Titans release safety Jamal Adams, honoring his request","Welcome to ESPN India Edition
Check out some of Jamal Adams' career highlights and stats after his release by the Tians. (0:48)
NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- TheTitanshonored three-time Pro Bowl safetyJamal Adams' request to be released, parting ways with him Thursday.
Adams signed a one-year deal with the Titans in July after he was released by theSeattle Seahawks. Joining the Titans gave Adams an opportunity to be reunited with defensive coordinator Dennard Wilson, who served as Adams' defensive backs coach when he was the No. 6 pick by theNew York Jetsin the 2017 NFL draft.
""At this point, wish Jamal all the best going forward, it just didn't work out here,"" Wilson told reporters Thursday. ""He'll have great success wherever he goes.""
While with the Titans, Adams played a total of 20 snaps in three games, including two in his Titans debut against the Jets in Week 2. Adams played a season-high 17 snaps the following week against theGreen Bay Packers. But his frustration level peaked after playing just one snap against theMiami Dolphinsin Week 4.
Adams told ESPN on Thursday that he wasn't frustrated about not being a starter, he just wanted an opportunity to contribute. So, he requested to be released.
The primary issue from the Titans' point of view was a lack of practice, according to a team source. Adams missed extensive time during training camp as he fought through a hip injury. The Titans placed Adams on the non-football injury list this past Saturday.
The veteran defensive back said he's healthy and ready to help out the next team he joins."
England's Thomas Tuchel similar to Sarina Wiegman - FA chief,"Welcome to ESPN India Edition
James Olley compares the differences between Thomas Tuchel and Gareth Southgate. (2:07)
Football Association chief Mark Bullingham has said he sees ""parallels"" betweenEnglandwomen's boss Sarina Wiegman and newly apppointed men's coach Thomas Tuchel.
Tuchel, who signed an18-month contract with Englandon Wednesday, will be hoping to repeat the success Wiegman, another non-English manager, brought to her side.
The Dutch coach led the women's team to win their first major trophy by lifting the Euro 2022 title on home soil, while Tuchel will be looking to earn the men's side to their first triumph since 1966 when he leads his team into the 2026 World Cup in the United States.
""I think Sarina would say she felt she came into a team that was ready to win and she instilled that confidence in the team and I think part of that came from the fact she was a proven winner,"" Bullinghamtold BBC 5 Live.
""Of course, we see parallels for that and that was forefront in our mind, when we were looking for a head coach, someone who could really give the team confidence and they had what it takes to win.""
Tuchel, who will begin work on Jan. 1, said he believes England areready to winanother major trophy.
""I think it's just nuances, it's just details,"" he told a news conference on Wednesday. ""If you lose on penalties in a final, who would I be to say I know what you did wrong when you were there.
""You were there. We or they have been in two finals I think. Semifinals and quarterfinals. Lost each of them very, very close, each of them could have gone either way. The genuine belief is that we are there, that we are ready."""

Nedum Onuoha and Julien Laurens discuss Erik ten Hag's future at Man United after club executives met in London. (1:49)
David Beckham has backed minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe to bring necessary change toManchester United, but admitted it could take time for the club to return to the top.
United have not won thePremier Leaguetitle since Beckham's former manager Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013 and last season recorded their worst-ever Premier League finish, coming eighth.
But the sporting structure at Old Trafford has been overhauled under Ratcliffe since becoming a minority owner in February and Beckham said those changes were sorely needed.
""I think that it definitely needed change,"" Beckham told his former United andEnglandteammateRio Ferdinand on his ""Rio Ferdinand Presents"" podcast. ""Speaking as a United fan, I think that many people had said that the club needed change and it needed a fresh perspective in how this club needs to be run and the decisions that are made.
""I really like Jim [Ratcliffe]. I've met him a few times over the years with a few mutual friends and I think that he's a fan and obviously he's a great businessman as well, one of the best and one of the biggest. But I think more importantly the fans see that he cares, and I think that that's a big part of it.
""I think obviously the fans had lost faith with the leadership over the years and obviously he really cares about what he wants to do and what he wants to create. So, hopefully, things will change but these things take time. These things take time.
""I think we have been quite patient as United fans over the years, but we want those good old days back. We want those days back, and the sooner the better.""
While United have continued to struggle this season, Beckham has enjoyed much greater success with his own team,Inter Miami. The club has already claimed the Supporters' Shield as MLS' best regular-season team and on Saturday could break the all-time record for most points in a single season.
The team has been led byArgentinagreatLionel Messi. And Beckham said that he took some inspiration from Ferguson when bringing the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner to Miami last year.
""I think that one of the things that I learned from the boss over the years -- and it wasn't something that he specifically told me -- one of the things that I learned from the boss was it's not about bringing the biggest and best players, it's about bringing the right players.
""If you can bring the biggest and best players that is the right player. There's not many of them around, but with Leo we knew that we were bringing and I knew that, yes he was going to be successful on the field but I also knew that he was going to help our club off the field."""
"Lonzo Ball scores 10 in return, reflects on rehab: 'All behind me now'","Welcome to ESPN India Edition
CHICAGO -- AsLonzo Ballchecked into his first NBA game in more than 2½ years Wednesday night, the United Center crowd serenaded him with a standing ovation. He threw his hands in the air and tapped his heart, acknowledging the crowd before playing for the first time since Jan. 14, 2022.
Ball was restricted to 15 minutes, but finished with 10 points on 4-of-6 shooting from the field in Chicago's 125-123 preseason victory against Minnesota.
""Felt a lot better playing than watching,"" Ball said after the game. ""I couldn't even put it into words how it felt being out there. ... It was definitely a moment I'll never forget.""
Since playing in his last NBA game more than 1,000 days ago, Ball has undergone three arthroscopic procedures on his left knee, including a rare double cartilage transplant in March 2023.
""Long. Really long,"" Ball said with a laugh of his recovery process. ""But looking back on it, it went a lot faster than I thought. ... Them telling me 18 more months recovery [after the third surgery], it sounds crazy in the moment, but now I'm here. It's all behind me now.""
Earlier Wednesday, Ball said he was ""full of joy"" to be preparing for a game again but also acknowledged he would not be the same player he was when he last took the court for a game.
""It's not the same body I started off with,"" Ball said after Wednesday's shootaround. ""But I think I can still be productive and effective on the court. That's why I'm still trying to play.""
And Wednesday night, Ball made an impact every time he stepped on the court. He knocked down his first shot, a corner 3-pointer, and then threw up three fingers as he ran up the court. He stole the ball fromJulius Randleon another possession and dove into the Bulls bench to save it from going out of bounds.
In his first season in Chicago in 2021-22, Ball averaged 13.0 points, 5.4 rebounds and 5.1 assists on 42% shooting in 35 games. And in his first game back, he did a little bit of everything on the court: collecting one block, one steal, one assist and one rebound.
""I thought he looked great,"" Bulls coach Billy Donovan said. ""There's a lot of things he does in the game that he doesn't really require anything with his knee or his body, he uses his brain so much. He moved really, really well.""
And most importantly for both he and the Bulls, he wasn't thinking about his knee while playing.
""That's a positive thing,"" Ball said. ""I didn't feel it at all. I felt like I was moving great. So now it's just about building, just continue to do it night and night out.""
Donovan said the Bulls would monitor Ball's knee to see how it reacted to his first game action, and he was almost certain to have a light day in practice Thursday. Ball said he also planned to play in Friday's preseason finale against theCleveland Cavaliers.
""I think he's going to need to play,"" Donovan said. ""That's kind of the normal NBA rhythm, playing every other day.""
Throughout the recovery process, Ball, who will turn 27 later this month, remained confident he'd return to the court, seeking opinions from multiple knee specialists until he found a path to recovery.
""I think it's the belief in myself -- knowing what I was feeling, knowing that I was a good age to come back from it,"" Ball said. ""I'm just trusting in the doctors and people around me.""
By August, Ball was cleared to play in 5-on-5 scrimmages. He arrived at the Bulls' facility a few weeks ahead of training camp to begin working out with the rest of the team. He had expected to make his preseason debut earlier in the schedule, but he was set back a few days after testing positive for COVID-19.
Ball has also had bouts of soreness throughout the preseason, which he said was to be expected. He emphasized both he and the team would have to manage his workload and playing time this season.
""We have a good handle right now, but I think it's going to change throughout the year,"" Ball said. ""Every day is going to be a different challenge we just have to overcome."""
Sabrina Ionescu secures Liberty Game 3 win vs. Lynx in WNBA Finals,"Welcome to ESPN India Edition
MINNEAPOLIS --Sabrina Ionescuhad to watch video in the locker room of her winning 3-pointer Wednesday night to know just how long it was. But she said that as soon as she launched it, she thought, ""Yeah, this is in.""
Ionescu's 28-foot dagger that swished with 1 second left -- ""definitely the biggest shot of my career"" -- gave theNew York Libertyan80-77 come-from-behind winover theMinnesota Lynxin Game 3 of the WNBA Finals. The Liberty are now one victory away from their first league title in franchise history.
""I would say I visualize a lot when I'm practicing in the offseason, the night before a game, the day of a game,"" Ionescu said. ""I'm always visualizing different scenarios and putting myself in tough situations. Obviously, I didn't play my best tonight, but finding a way to continue to stick with it ... I feel like that's been a big growth for me, whether the ball is going in or not.""
This one went in, the 10th 3-pointer of the game for the Liberty. Ionescu's shot left the Lynx's record crowd of 19,521 stunned, much like Minnesota did to the New York crowd in Game 1, a 95-93 Lynx win in overtime.
The Liberty lost an 18-point lead in that game; the Lynx lost a 15-point edge Wednesday. In both cases, there were dramatic momentum shifts and huge plays in the kind of heavyweight matchup expected when the top two seeds play for a championship.
""The hardest thing to do when we're in a series ... is there's so many ups and downs and swings,"" Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve said, ""and it takes special mental toughness and physical toughness to weather those swings. We're disappointed -- we're home, we played well and just couldn't come up with the win.
""We have to dust ourselves off and get another crack at it here at home. We'll see what we can do on Friday.""
The teams will return to Target Center with the Lynx trying to send the series back to New York for a deciding Game 5 on Sunday. Minnesota has an uphill battle, but it has been done before. Four other teams have won the WNBA title after being down 2-1 in the Finals, including the Lynx in 2017.
The Liberty want to end the series Friday. They are one of three original WNBA teams still in the city where they started; the other two, theLos Angeles SparksandPhoenix Mercury, each have won three titles.
This was the fourth go-ahead 3-pointer in the final 5 seconds of a game in WNBA Finals history, and the first since Maya Moore in 2015. It was the first by the Liberty since 1999, when Teresa Weatherspoon hit ""The Shot.""
New York has played for the championship five times before this year. One of the most dramatic of those series losses was in 1999, when the Liberty won Game 2 of what was then a best-of-three series at Houston on Teresa Weatherspoon's shot at the buzzer from beyond half court, only to lose the next day to the Comets.
Weatherspoon's shot, often cited as the most famous in league history, is one of four times that a WNBA player has made a winning 3-pointer in the last 5 seconds of a Finals game. The others were Minnesota's Maya Moore in Game 3 in 2015 againstIndiana, and Los Angeles'Nikki Teasleyin Game 2 in 2002 against New York.
Teasley's shot won that series in what was then still a best-of-three Finals. Moore and Minnesota lost Game 4 of the 2015 Finals, but then won Game 5 and the title.
So Ionescu is the fourth player to pull off this feat, and it came in a game that was eerily similar to New York's victory when Weatherspoon made her shot 25 years ago. The Liberty led for just 2 minutes, 19 seconds Wednesday, the second-shortest amount of time leading in a Finals win in WNBA history.
The shortest time to lead in a Finals win? You guessed it: Game 2 of the 1999 Finals, when the Liberty led the Comets for just 2:15 before Weatherspoon's buzzer-beater.
Trying to win a long-awaited championship for New York has been on Ionescu's mind since she was drafted No. 1 in 2020 in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic that cancelled the NCAA tournament her senior season atOregon.
Ionescu then suffered a season-ending ankle injury in her third Liberty game. She left the WNBA's COVID-19 bubble in Bradenton, Florida, and went home to California to rehab. Ionescu said she couldn't bring herself to watch many Liberty games on television the rest of that season, as the team finished 2-20.
Then, before the 2023 season, she was joined by free agentsBreanna StewartandCourtney Vandersloot, andJonquel Jones, who arrived via trade. Those players and Ionescu helped form the core of the team that is playing in its second consecutive WNBA Finals.
The Liberty lost 3-1 to theLas Vegas Aceslast season, but the players said they learned a lot about themselves in the process. This season, New York had the best record in the regular season (32-8) and is the No. 1 seed.
The Liberty didn't look like it in the first quarter Wednesday. Contrary to fast starts in the first two games of the Finals, the Liberty trailed 28-18 after the first quarter. They cut the deficit to 43-35 by halftime.
In the third quarter, though, Stewart took over, scoring 14 points and bringing New York to within 62-61. The Lynx defense was hampered somewhat by forwardAlanna Smithdealing with a back injury she suffered in the second quarter. She still played nearly 20 minutes but was clearly in pain.
Stewart previously won WNBA titles in 2018 and 2020 with the team that drafted her No. 1 in 2016, theSeattle Storm. Now playing for the team in her home state of New York, Stewart had a tough finish to Game 1 when she missed a free throw at the end of regulation and a layup at the end of overtime.
Since then, though, Stewart has come back strong. Along with her game-high 30 points Wednesday, she had 11 rebounds and 4 blocks.
""We don't win this game without Stewie,"" Ionescu said.
Ionescu, Jones andLeonie Fiebicheach finished with 13 points.
Ionescu was named to the All-WNBA second team earlier Wednesday; some thought she should have been on the first team.
""That was just a great All-WNBA second-team performance,"" Ionescu joked after the game.
New York coach Sandy Brondello said even if Ionescu was 4-of-11 from the field before the winning shot, she never doubted for a minute she should take it.
""Obviously, Stewie got us back in there, willed us in there,"" Brondello said. ""But I thought, '[At] the right time, this is Sabrina.' She's a great shooter.
""What I love about her is that she backs herself. Not everyone can take those big shots and make them. She can.""

"Check-in on Real Madrid, Man United, Liverpool, Barcelona","Welcome to ESPN India Edition
Gab Marcotti and Julien Laurens react to reports of Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal preparing another monstrous transfer offer for Real Madrid's Vinicius Júnior. (0:53)
Life is a funny thing. You organize and scheme with the hope that your preparations will have you ready for whatever lies ahead, but as Mike Tyson once said, ""Everyone has a plan until you punch them in the face."" And when you're a big club dealing with marathon-long seasons, truer words have never been spoken.
This upcoming weekend will mark over two months since the start of thePremier LeagueandLaLiga(and just less in theBundesliga), so with that in mind, we take a closer look at five teams across Europe that started with specific hopes and objectives to see whether they're keeping up with preseason promises or flailing after the first couple months.
Thebiggest storyline of the summerwasKylian Mbappé'sarrival at Real Madrid. For the LaLiga and European champs, the world's biggest star joining them was a clear win from the standpoint of brand optics. Madrid also won financially, given his free transfer fromParis Saint-Germain. In my opinion, the move was more necessary for Mbappé than Real Madrid so that he could prove himself in a tougher league.
On his league debut, Imentionedon ""SportsCenter"" that manager Carlo Ancelotti's biggest headache would be to balance the chemistry betweenJude Bellingham,Rodrygo, Mbappé andVinícius Júnior, specifically the latter two as they have an affinity for attacking from the left wing.
In other words, there might be too many cooks in the kitchen.
ButAncelotti knows that Real Madrid, as usual, will eventually figure it out. And he's somewhat right. In LaLiga, Real Madrid are second to Hansi Flick'sBarcelonawith 21 points, have not lost yet and after failing to score in his first three matches since his goal againstAtalantain the UEFA Super Cup, Mbappé finally got going, netting seven goals so far with five in the league.
He was out of action for the Madrid derby (which they tied 1-1) after suffering a thigh injury, but he returned for the Champions League loss againstLille-- who ended Madrid's 36-match unbeaten run in the competition -- and the following 2-0 league victory againstVillarreal. Although his fitness is questionable, the Frenchman is picking up steam. Still, we've yet to see this Madrid team hit top gear.
Ancelotti's confidence is only partly right because Real Madrid are competing withoutToni Kroos, who retired this summer. Kroos was key in connecting midfield and attack, which is the biggest issue with the team right now.
""Real Madrid are predictable, they are slow, [and] it is very difficult for them to filter passes,"" said former Madrid player Guti in the popular Spanish TV show ""El Chiringuito."" ""It is very difficult for them to play in space, everyone wants the passes at their feet and that is very difficult in today's football.""
I think the perfect example of Guti's sentiments was Madrid's loss to Lille. There was a sense of detachment throughout the game where the front three kept swapping roles but found no success. The added headache ofDani Carvajal'sseason-ending injuryis also a huge problem. Meanwhile, Vinícius is also hurt but should return within a week or so.
So there you have it. Real Madrid and Mbappé are doing relatively fine and will find ways to get results. But this season, in big games against strong teams -- both in the league and Europe -- they will have a harder time finding success.El Clásicoon Oct. 26(stream live on ESPN+ at 3 p.m. ET, U.S. only)might be an early determinant for the title race, but one thing is for certain: If Real Madrid end up retaining the LaLiga trophy and winning the Champions League once again, it will have been a much tougher task than last season.
On the eve of the season opener betweenManchester UnitedandFulham, manager Erik ten Hag spoke confidently of the campaign ahead and how the past two seasons showed the blueprint for success at Old Trafford.
""We know we are in the right direction, we know we have won two trophies and we know our game model,""saidTen Hag in his first prematch conference of the season. ""So, now we have to integrate the new players where we think they can improve the game model, improve the team levels and we take it from there. I always have very high expectations but we want to go for trophies.""
These were not unrealistic targets from Ten Hag, who -- after all -- had won the FA Cup in impressive fashion againstManchester Citythree months earlier. In order to build on their momentum, the club hit the third-highest net spend in the league ($145 million-plus) as Ten Hag refreshed his squad. Several players such asScott McTominay,Aaron Wan-Bissaka,Raphaël VaraneandDonny van de Beekleft whileMatthijs de Ligt,Leny YoroandNoussair Mazraouicame in to revamp the defensive unit.Manuel Ugartealso arrived to bolster the midfield, whileJoshua Zirkzee's signing inspired optimism for the United attack.
Don Hutchison explains his number one pick to replace Erik ten Hag at Manchester United, should the club decide to remove the Dutchman from his role.
Eight weeks later and the Red Devils don't look like a trophy favorite or a top-six team. They are currently 14th with eight points in the league, which is their lowest tally in Premier League history after seven matches. They are on a run of five games without a win in all competitions, and they have only two league victories.
Defensively, they have conceded eight goals, which is notsoawful because Ten Hag has had to rely onHarry MaguireandJonny Evans-- not his first-choice center-back pairing. But United's attack is what really illustrates their poor form as they have only scored five goals so far, and only last-placedSouthamptonhave scored fewer (4).
Marcus RashfordandRasmus Højlundhave not impacted much, though the latter recently returned from injury. And Zirkzee? After scoring against Fulham in the opener, he has yet to find the back of the net.Bruno Fernandes, United's captain and most influential player, has also been disappointing. Now, it must be said that injuries have not helped (Yoro was a big loss and now Mazraoui will besidelinedfor a few weeks due to a heart procedure), but that still doesn't excuse their low position in the table.
After drawing withAston Villa, Ten Hag tried to calm the storm by saying that United was a ""long-term"" project. But the question United fans will surely ask is, ""Does this long-term project have an ending?""
Hansi Flick's arrival at Barcelona was always in the cards. Back in 2021, after the German manager had ledBayern Munichto a historic treble a season prior, ESPNreportedthat Barcelona president Joan Laporta had inquired about his availability.
But in the end, Flick chose to lead the German national team, and that partnership ended last year in September after poor results and a group stage exit at the 2022 World Cup. Laporta still wanted Flick, though, because he admired the German's philosophy of high pressing, attention to fitness and firm-hand approach.
His wish came true this summer after Flick replaced Xavi Hernández, but there was some doubt about the appointment. It was less about Flick and more about how much he would have to deal with, given Barcelona's financial problems and that Barça seemed far off from reaching the heights of their glamorous rivals Real Madrid, who had stolen the headlines with Mbappé's arrival.
But so far, Flick is exactly what the doctor ordered. After nine matches, Barça are top of LaLiga with 24 points, having won every game bar one. They have conceded nine in the league, which is one less than at this stage last season. Offensively, they have 28 goals, seven higher than last season at this time of the campaign.
Robert Lewandowski, who was doubted to perform given his age (36), has been in tremendous form, scoring 10 goals in nine league matches, with two more in the Champions League. Meanwhile,Lamine Yamalhas remained one of the best players in the game right now with five assists and four goals in the league.
However,Raphinha, to me, is the one talk about. He has been magnificent and has made the most of Ousmane Dembélé's departure. In his first two seasons, he managed 10 goals in each campaign in all competitions. This season? He already has six goals and five assists. In fact, no other player across Europe's five top leagues has created more chances (39) for his team than the Brazilian. And it's not even November! The weight of the captain's armband has also been a positive as Raphinha has embraced the responsibility afterMarc-André ter Stegen's long-term injury.
Everything Laporta loves about Flick is working. The German has implemented more intensity and off-the-ball discipline.
""We work much harder than before,""saidmidfielderPedrilast month. ""The new fitness coaches are really good for us. We work hard and you notice it in the games. The team doesn't dip after the 70th or 80th minute, it maintains the same fitness levels.""
Flick has also helped integrate moreLa Masiaplayers into the first team. In the 3-0 win against Alavés, Flick started six players who graduated from Barça's famous academy, includingMarc Casadó, who has been brilliant in midfield.
Now, it's still early and there are notable injuries and issues to deal with -- including those to new signingDani Olmoand the aforementioned Ter Stegen, which forced Barcelona to bringWojciech Szczesnyout of retirement to compete with young shot-stopperIñaki Peña. It is also vital to protect the young players from burnout, including Yamal, whosuffered an injury scareduring international duty.
But for the most part, Flick's regimented, no-nonsense, super fit squad is delivering for Barcelona.
How do you replace a legendary manager who won multiple trophies including the Champions League (three finals) and the Premier League title at a time of Pep Guardiola/Man City dominance? Jurgen Klopp was not only a respected head coach, he was an adopted Liverpudlian, so anyone who came in to replace him had an almost impossible task of delivering success as well as earning the admiration of loyal supporters.
As of right now, Liverpool's executive board can feel satisfied because Arne Slot has been exactly what the club needed after losing Klopp. The Reds lead the Premier League table with 18 points, but most importantly, the Dutch manager has been excellent in applying his strategy. Klopp's heavy metal football was tattooed on the team, but Slot has been calculated in the club's transition. He didn't eradicate the previous philosophy; he modified it.
Trent Alexander-Arnoldhas gone back to his original role as a right-back rather than marauding into midfield,Ibrahima Konatéis turning into one of the best center-backs in the league,Luis Díazis on his way to producing more goals in half a season than he did the entire previous campaign andRyan Gravenberchcould be their most important player (no other member of the squad has made more recoveries or interceptions than him, in addition to having an almost 90% pass accuracy rate).
Under Slot, Liverpool do more with less. Their possession and shot creation is relatively lower than in Klopp's era, but their productivity and output is high.
There is one caveat, though. Liverpool has statistically played the easiest schedule out of any Premier League team so far, and once they return from the international break, things are about to get much harder. Between the end of this international window and the next one on Nov. 14, Slot's side has to faceChelsea,Arsenal, Brighton (twice), Aston Villa as well as Champions League matches againstRB LeipzigandBayer Leverkusen. Things don't get easier after that as they will also face Real Madrid and Man City in the space of five days.
Liverpool are currently on a great roll thanks to their Slot machine, but soon, we'll find out whether they're the real deal.
Admit it. Vincent Kompany's summer arrival at Bayern Munich from newly relegated Burnley surprised you, didn't it?
I was shocked, especially since there were other, more experienced coaches in contention. The perennial Bundesliga winners finished third in 2023-24 and trophyless for the first time since 2011-12, despiteHarry Kane's tremendous debut season (36 league goals to win the European Golden Shoe).
Ultimately, Kompany's appointment was about methodology. The move for the former Man City captain was about returning to what was pure about Bayern Munich. They wanted to win again, but in their own way. The Bavarians wanted someone who could implement an attractive philosophy that suited their personnel. Since Pep Guardiola had been there, done that and already had a job, who better to bring in than a former student of his? Kompany is ambitious, smart and most notably, willing to carry out the teachings he learned from Guardiola, who had incredible success with Bayern between 2013 and 2016.
In the league, the club is undefeated and leads the table on goal difference, having scored a league high of 20 goals. Overall, Bayern 33 goals in all competitions and Kane has 10 of them. Their average possession (66%) is thebestin the league and their pass success rate is more than 90%, also leading the Bundesliga.
However, there are elements of Kompany's strategy that leave vulnerable gaps because their intense pressure and high-line tactics often allow smart teams to counter attack with precision. Their loss to Aston Villa in the Champions League -- whereJhon Duráninstinctively caughtManuel Neueroff his line -- is a perfect example. In fact, the past three matches have them on a winless run (1-1 vs. Bayer Leverkusen, 1-0 loss to Villa, 3-3 vs.Eintracht Frankfurt) and much of this is because of opponents' ability to react to the counter-pressing.
How the team wins back possession as quickly as possible will be Kompany's most important task on his to-do list. If Bayern Munich are to reclaim their throne, they need to be smarter without the ball, not just with it."
Pro Kabaddi League 2024-25: The only PKL 11 preview you need,"Welcome to ESPN India Edition
The second decade of the Pro Kabaddi League begins on the 18th of October, signalling the maturing of the league into arguably the most popular franchise sport in India after the IPL. PKL 11 brings with it a whole host of changes, including revamped squads following the player auctions in August, and a few format changes as well.
With the squads newly refreshed, there are murmurs that we could witness one of the most competitive seasons of Pro Kabaddi yet, and this bodes well afterPuneri Paltan's dominant road to the titlelast year.
Here's what to look forward to in PKL 11.
Kabaddi home|PKL 11: Full coverage
We'll get to the squads later, but the headline change is a shift from the 12-city caravan format and return to a three-legged affair. The first leg begins in Hyderabad (October 18 to November 9), then moves on to Noida (November 10 to December 2) and then finishes up in Pune (December 3 to 24), after which the playoffs and the final take place in a venue to be announced later. With two games taking place almost every day, we will witness 137 games of kabaddi over the next three months.
A major shift away from the veterans - all 12 of the teams have exceeded their New Young Player (NYP) quota, with the likes of Rahul Chaudhari going unsold, and Pardeep Narwhal only fetching ₹70 lakh. Taking a cue from defending champions Puneri Paltan, who need not have even come to the auction having retained almost all of their championship team thanks to the NYP rule with their academy products, many other franchises have focused on youth.
That said, large amounts were still spent, with Tamil Thalaivas makings Sachin Tanwar the most expensive signing at ₹2.15 Cr, closely followed by Guman Singh, who went to the Gujarat Giants for ₹1.97 Cr. Haryana Steelers, last year's beaten finalists, swooped to sign their Iranian star, Mohammedreza Shadloui Chiyaneh for a whopping ₹2.07 Cr.

- ProKabaddi (@ProKabaddi)October 14, 2024
It's hard to look beyond last season's finalists. Puneri Paltan may have lost Shadloui, but in captain and league MVP Aslam Inamdar, Mohit Goyat, Akash Shinde, Pankaj Mohite, Abinesh Nadarajan, Gaurav Khatri, Sanket Sawant, Aditya Shinde and new raider Ajith Kumar they have nine starters (from the required seven) already.
The league's most impressive attacking lineup, that revolutionised the league with having all-round raiders who spread raiding duties amongst themselves and were equally adept in defence, are a well-oiled machine - where Shadloui was an important cog - but one wouldn't put it past the team to overcome his loss. Do so, and Puneri Paltan could become only the second team ever to defend their title and coach BC Ramesh could go on to win his fourth PKL trophy.
Haryana Steelers, who had little answer to Puneri Paltan in last season's final, have shored up what they were best at last season, adding Shadloui to an already impressive defence. With coach Manpreet Singh effectively implementing the footballing equivalent of one-nil-ling his way to victory, the problem for the Steelers remains that 'one'. However, Shadloui could provide a boost in their raiding prowess as well, supporting Vinay and Shivan Patare in attack. Balance could be the key as the Steelers aim to go one better.
Tamil Thalaivas spent big in the auction and could spring a surprise, especially with the unique concept of Udaya Kumar as head coach and Dharamaraj Cheralathan as a strategy coach. In Sachin, they have a do-or-die raid specialist who could do wonders under Cheralathan as raiding responsibilities get shared with Narender. The only worry is the lack of all-rounders apart from new signing Moeen Safaghi and it places undue pressure on the Iranian in his debut PKL season. The Thalaivas have an impressive, balanced starting lineup, and should they be injury-free, could surprise many and walk away with the title.
Bengal Warriorz had the best raiding unit in PKL 10 and the lowest tackle points. They've gone the simple route in solving their problems - retaining Maninder Singh on the attacking side and bringing in Fazel Atrachali in defence. The Iranian is a stellar captain and can guide a youthful defence alongside former UP Yoddhas captain Nitesh Kumar. However, the lack of all-rounders in their squad and few options in depth mean things have to go very right for new coach Prashant Surve to lift the title.
Gujarat Giants signed 15 players at the auction, and under the guidance of PKL stalwart Ram Mehar Singh, Guman Singh will lead their raiding outfit. The squad is a bit youthful, and the likes of all-rounder Mohammad Nabibakhsh will be needed to aid a defence that looks a bit thin on paper. However, should their raft of new signings gel well, this could be an outfit that surprises many.
They released Pawan Sehrawat and used the FBM card (Final Bid Match) at the auction to retain him for a lower price, and then added PKL season 8 winning coach, Krishan Kumar Hooda as well as the second-best defender from last season, Krishan Dhull. The Titans were quite active in the auction, with an emphasis on all-rounders and they definitely look on course to avoid a last-place finish for the fourth consecutive season. Should Pawan also receive support in raiding duties, a playoff spot looks likely.
With Telugu Titans likely to compete well this season, it's hard to predict who will struggle this season, especially given the rest of the league has also assembled balanced squads. Even the likes of Dabang Delhi and Patna Pirates weren't too active in the auction but retained most of their squad. Injuries and squad harmony could be key as the fight for the playoff spots might be the tightest we have witnessed, especially with Jaipur Pink Panthers, U Mumba and UP Yodhhas now boasting of very balanced squads.

- ProKabaddi (@ProKabaddi)October 16, 2024
Pardeep Narwal is fighting for relevance, and heads to play under the coach who gave him his debut, Randhir Singh Sehrawat with the Bengaluru Bulls. They've also added Ajinkya Pawar and Jai Bhagwan to their raiding lineup, but the team's fortunes all revolve around how the veteran performs. Poor fitness and form saw him have a very middling PKL 10 with the UP Yoddhas, only scoring 122 points. He's claimed to have put in the effort ahead of this season to up his fitness and is aiming for 200 points, but the question marks are ever-present for the veteran.
Pawan Sehrawat cannot stat-pad with raiding points alone anymore, as evidenced by him opting to be listed as an all-rounder in the PKL 11 auction. He can be handy in defence, but if the Telugu Titans are going to achieve anything this season, they'll need their superstar to provide in other aspects of the game as well.
The writing is on the wall for many of the old guard - the league expects more, and as Rahul Chaudhari found out - there's no room for sentiment.
The emphasis on young players with a different level of athleticism and professionalism could see tighter contests than before. The league has also recognised that specialist raiders have had their day and are aiming to emulate Puneri Paltan in having raiders shoulder plenty of the defensive burden as well.
With a league-wide emphasis on defence, and an improvement in general athleticism, we could witness even more impressive feats of ingenuity as raiders fight to score against well drilled defences. It's all set to be a thrilling season of kabaddi."

(Nestor Albiach 5', Alaeddine Ajaraie (P) 89' - Wilmar Jordan Gil 25', 51', Lukas Brambilla (P) 36')
Chennaiyin FC produced a superb comeback to grab an impressive win away to NorthEast United, notching up a 3-2 victory. Owen Coyle's men leapfrogged NEUFC in the table, climbing to fourth place, while the hosts fell to eighth in the table.
NorthEast opened the scoring early, winning the ball back deep in their own half before proceeding swiftly up the pitch. Nestor Albiach spread the ball wide to Jithin MS, who sent a clever pass to Parthib making a run into the right channel. The Indian forward did well to curl a low cross past multiple defenders, allowing Nestor to tap the ball home. NEUFC were firmly in control, and Ajaraei spurned a great chance to make it 2-0 a few minutes later. They were made to pay in the 25th minute, when Wilmar Jordan Gil rose high and headed in a corner from Connor Shields.
Chennaiyin completed the comeback 10 minutes later when Michel Zabaco dragged down Ryan Edwards in the box and conceded a penalty. Lukas Brambilla made no mistake from the spot, drilling the ball into the top left corner to give the visitors the lead in the 36th minute - which they retained going into the break.
Owen Coyle's men then scored from another corner in the second half, although NEUFC cleared the first phase, only to lose the ball, allowing CFC to loft it back into the box, where Jordan Gil beat the offside trap, controlled the ball and volleyed it home to make it 3-1 in the 51st minute. Chennaiyin FC held on as the half progressed, but Laldinliana Renthlei's second yellow card in the 84th minute complicated matters as they went down to ten men.
Irfan Yadwad then made a clumsy foul in the box on Alaeddine Ajaraie in the 88th minute, conceding a penalty and handing the hosts a lifeline. Ajaraie sent CFC keeper Samik Mitra the wrong way and scored for the fifth consecutive game, one short of the ISL record held by Elano. NEUFC threw the kitchen sink at CFC in injury time, but the visitors held on for the win."

As the Indian Super League heads into a two-week break now for the international break, a draw-filled matchweek 4 had its share of storylines emerge, with some big sides heading into the break with plenty of thinking to do.
You can find the basic details and stats from each gamehere, but here is the fourth installment of our ISL musings this season.
ISL Standings|ISL Results and Fixtures
Thirty shots on goal, a penalty missed and the woodwork hit twice - East Bengal did everything but score in Bino George's first game in charge of the first team. Unfortunately, they also conceded twice to lose 2-0 to Jamshedpur FC, who notched up their third win of the season.
Cleiton Silva had a torrid evening in front of goal, as he spurned a few straightforward opportunities. Saul Crespo made a meal of a penalty, handing Albino Gomes a straightforward save too, making the Jamshedpur goalkeeper the man with the most penalty saves in ISL history - five.
East Bengal's biggest concern will be their fitness. They seemed unable to keep up the pace required to chase the game in the second half. They might have slumped to their fourth consecutive loss of the season, but the international break comes at a good time for them to work on their fitness and also build on the good build-up play that they displayed in the loss to Jamshedpur.
Mohammedan SC's head coach Andrey Chernyshov said his team were driving a Tata but couldn't keep up with the Ferrari that Mohun Bagan were driving in a one-sided game at the Salt Lake Stadium which Bagan ended up winning 3-0.
First of many! 🤩💚♥️

- Mohun Bagan Super Giant (@mohunbagansg)October 6, 2024
He was right. Bagan were dominant. They had 22 shots in all, 12 of them on target. Ashique Kuruniyan looked sharp in his ISL comeback, and Jose Molina finally found a combination that stopped Bagan from looking flimsy. Tom Aldred and Alberto Rodriguez were solid in the heart of the defence, and Greg Stewart and Jamie Maclaren, in a very nascent stage of their partnership, seemed to strike up an excellent understanding, too.
Bagan needed a reaction after their 3-0 loss to Bengaluru last week, and they did just that. This is a side filled with so many excellent individuals that it always felt like a matter of time before they found their feet in the league. Now it seems like they have, watch out rest of the ISL.
Eyebrows might have been raised when Bengaluru FC decided to bring Rahul Bheke back to the club this summer, considering Bheke's advancing age and they already had Chinglensana Singh too. Four games into the ISL, it looks like a masterstroke. In a season where no side has really found defensive stability yet, Bengaluru have conceded no goals in four games, the first team in ISL history to go through their first four games with four clean sheets.
RA-𝗛𝗨𝗟𝗞 BHEKE! 💪#MCFCBFC#ISL#LetsFootball#ISLonJioCinema#ISLonSports18#BengaluruFC#RahulBheke#ISLPOTM|@bengalurufc@Sports18@JioCinema@RahulBhekepic.twitter.com/TLYZ7fKkus
- Indian Super League (@IndSuperLeague)October 2, 2024
On his return to Mumbai this week, Bheke put in a standout performance at the heart of the defence. He read the game brilliantly, made decisive tackles when needed and was in the right place at the right time. His partnership with Aleks Jovanovic and the protection they receive from Pedro Capo, who's only getting better with every game he's playing, make Bengaluru such a difficult team to break down.
They might have wanted to achieve more in Mumbai than just a 0-0 draw and had their chances as well, but 10 points in four games with no goals conceded is a start to the season that Bengaluru can have few complaints about.
It is very unlike both an Owen Coyle team and Mumbai City FC to struggle to score goals consistently. Right now, neither has found a balance between defence and attack this season. Both have played three games so far and when they've scored two goals or more, they've also conceded two goals or more. When they've not conceded a goal, they haven't scored either.
Chennaiyin have picked up just a point from two games against Mohammedan SC and Hyderabad FC, which they will regard as opportunities missed. They didn't create enough chances either.
Mumbai City, meanwhile, huffed and puffed against Bengaluru and couldn't put their opponents under enough pressure while being solid at the back themselves. The combinations between Brandon Fernandes and the rest of the attack hasn't exactly clicked yet, which might be a big reason why they haven't fired as an attacking unit just yet.
Noah Sadaoui and Jesus Jimenez are a joy to watch as a partnership. They've struck up an understanding so soon, assisting a goal for each other in a 2-2 draw against Odisha FC. However, the concern for Mikael Stahre would be what happened after the two put the Blasters up 2-0.
First, they didn't defend a set-piece well enough and then Diego Mauricio scored to equalise for Odisha as well. Odisha have enough quality, of course, but the Blasters didn't make them work hard enough to come back into the game. Eventually, if not for Odisha's profligate finishing in the second half, the Blasters might not have even ended up with the point that they got.
With Adrian Luna back now, the Blasters attack is in safe hands (feet). But with one less foreigner available for their defence should they fit Luna into the side, Stahre has a big task on his hands in finding that balance.
Having added more foreigners to their squad in the last couple of weeks, Hyderabad are swiftly becoming a more cohesive team, especially in defence. The inexperience of their young attackers is still showing with their decisions in critical moments, which is why they haven't yet scored a goal this season.
However, the defensive partnership of Alex Saji and Stefan Sapic was outstanding against Chennaiyin FC, as Thangboi Singto's side picked up their first point of the season in their first game at home. With more experience for the youngsters in attack and more sharpness for Cy Goddard and Allan Paulista, they will become a threat going forward too, but being solid at the back is a good foundation for Singto to build on."

Can Klopp make Red Bull more likeable? Probably not in Germany,"Welcome to ESPN India Edition
Tom Hamilton explains Jürgen Klopp's new role as global head of soccer at Red Bull from the start of 2025. (1:42)
It has been nearly a decade since Jürgen Klopp last worked full time for a German football entity, but he remains the most ubiquitous face on television in theBundesrepublik.
Switch on ARD/ZDF breakfast television any weekday morning and you'll see segments of the show sponsored by financial services company Deutsche Vermögensberatung, accompanied by Klopp's friendly and familiar hearty laugh. It doesn't end there. Klopp is a natural product ambassador and has also helped promote everything from beer to exercise bikes to cars, chocolate bars and most recently, an electronics company.
So, it was no surprise that Red Bull CEO Oliver Mintzlaff went to tremendous lengths tosecure Klopp for the ever-expanding RB football world. The surprise to many arrived in the form of the self-described ""normal one"" accepting the offer. Why Red Bull? It's not exactly the most popular branch of football among German fans. Klopp surely could have picked from any number of next projects.
As ""global head of soccer,"" he'll advise all the clubs worldwide within the RB stable. Not coincidentally,RB Leipzigare coached by Marco Rose, his former player atMainz.
Meanwhile,RB Salzburghave Pepijn Lijnders, Klopp's formerLiverpoolassistant at the helm. At theNew York Red Bulls, it's Sandro Schwarz, who played with and under Klopp in Mainz before either man had hit the big-time world of football.
It undoubtedly helps when you get paid a lot of money to work with friends and former associates.
I've been struck by the differences in reaction between England and Germany. The English attitude seems to be one of ""Good luck to you, you've earned the right to do what you want next.""
In Germany, it was never going to be quite as relaxed. Leipzig remain polarising mostly due to the manner of their birth in 2009, buying the rights to the fifth-division Leipzig-area club SSV Markranstädt, and with only a limited membership, loyal to Red Bull management, thus avoiding issues withGerman football's 50+1 ownership structurewhereby members must own the majority of each club.
This makes RB pariahs to many traditional football fans, and for Klopp, the people's man, to associate himself with them was never going to be met with strong approval. The cover of last Thursday's Kicker, the specialty German football magazine,featured Klopp's face and the self-explanatory words ""Kultur-Schock.""Kicker's online poll of readers showed 72% disapproved of his move.
The Klopp topic opened Sunday's weekly Doppelpass panel discussion on Sport1 and, in contrast, most of the participants stood behind Klopp's decision. Particularly vocal in admiration of Red Bull was formerEintracht FrankfurtandHertha Berlinsporting chief Fredi Bobic.
""They have the right structures. I'm thinking only of the game and the sport,"" he said. ""Many traditionalists are still living in their past and in their romance. Now they're playing in the2. Bundesliga.""
Ouch.
Klopp says he's looking forward to learning again in his new role, but he already knows enough to understand that even though this is a move by Mintzlaff to make Red Bull seem more likeable, attitudes are hard to shift.
German fans seem to have more misgivings about Klopp's new role thanThomas Tuchel taking over theEnglandreins.
What is often not understood outside Germany is that England are simply not viewed as their ultimate rivals. Due toWorld Cuphistory,Italyand theNetherlandscan lay claim to this status more than the Three Lions.
James Olley compares the differences between Thomas Tuchel and Gareth Southgate.
It's well known that Tuchel, as he told my ESPN pitchside colleague Archie Rhind-Tuttnine months ago, feels a bond with English football and indeed feels more in tune with the country's football culture.
German fans tend to value the traditional aspects and atmosphere of the English game, if not the commercialisation of the sport that stands in stark contrast to what mostBundesligaclubs -- boasting considerable community focus -- stand for.
That Tuchel has opted to experience this culture as England manager is not something that will whip up anyone in Germany as it has among some strident English newspapers this week.
Germanydon't have the problem right now of a paucity of high-level coaches. Julian Nagelsmann, a year into his work asBundestrainer, has stamped his vision on to the national team and the performances have become easy on the eye.
I liked how ZDF analyst Christoph Kramer put it after the1-0 winover the Dutch on Monday night: ""If both teams had been playing in dark overalls, we would still know which team is Germany, because it has Nagelsmann's signature and you can see it.""

Qualifying for theUEFA Nations Leaguequarterfinals with such ease is not something we've grown accustomed to. Nagelsmann hit the jackpot withStuttgart'sJamie Lewelingin his Germany debut, scorer of a thumping goal and unlucky to see an earlier strike chalked off for a controversial and complex offside.
The inclusion of strikerTim Kleindienstin both games also merits mention. At 29, Kleindienst, previously withHeidenheimand now withBorussia Mönchengladbach, was selected due to theLeistungsprinzip-- performances dictate personnel.
Play well at club level and Nagelsmann is sure to notice. It marks such a bold change from the past when there seemingly had to be aBayern Munichblock and aBorussia Dortmundblock and you filled in the squad from there.
It seems only fair to update manager Pellegrino Matarazzo's situation inTSG Hoffenheim. I must admit while penningthis column just before the international break, I thought there was a good chance he would have been relieved of his duties by now.
But theLeistungsprinziphas come to the Italian-American's aid. It's difficult to dismiss someone after supervising fine back-to-back performances againstDynamo Kyiv(2-0) in theUEFA Europa Leagueand Stuttgart (1-1 away) in the Bundesliga.
In addition, Hoffenheim have just appointed highly regarded sporting director Andreas Schicker from Austrian championsSturm Graz, and he's not about to tear things up as he gets his feet under the table. The status quo for Matarazzo has been confirmed by Dr. Markus Schütz, chairman of the management board.
""We've never said it's his last game, but that we all have to be successful and as quickly as possible,"" Dr. Schütz said. ""There is no identifiable final. That would also ruin the atmosphere to set such ultimatums. It's pointless.""
Still, with only four points gathered from six games, this weekend's home match against bottom clubBochumwill tell us a lot."

Inside Sean Payton's 'game-day' alter ego,"Welcome to ESPN India Edition
WhenDenver Broncoscoach Sean Payton looks across the field at the Caesars Superdome on Thursday night, he'll be faced with 16 years of memories as the former coach of theNew Orleans Saints.
There wasSteve Gleason's blocked puntduring the Saints' first game back in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina in 2006 andGarrett Hartley's kick to send the 2009 squadto the Super Bowl. Payton watched Drew Brees break records from a suite while serving aBountygate suspensionin 2012 and witnessed the""No-Call"" heartbreak in the NFC Championship Gamefrom the 2018 season.
Payton's meticulous attention to detail, motivational tactics and domineering personality helped build a winning culture in New Orleans. He turned a franchise that had one playoff win into an offensive powerhouse, with nine postseason appearances and a Super Bowl victory.
Almost three years removed from the place where he won 152 games, Payton will be the man standing in the way of the Saints (2-4) on ""Thursday Night Football"" (8:15 p.m. ET, Prime Video) as he tries to continue to establish a culture in Denver and get the Broncos (3-3) back to the playoffs for the first time since 2015.
""I don't think there's going to be a lot of flowers and warm fuzzies for yours truly, and I get it. ... I can't stand losing,"" Payton said. ""It's about our team and me as the head coach of the Broncos getting ready to play on an early week and trying to play one of our better games.""
It's the first time Payton will face the Saints and coach Dennis Allen, who coached under Payton for 12 seasons in two separate stints. The Saintstraded Payton's contract to the Broncoslast year after he spent the 2022 season as an NFL analyst. New Orleans acquired the 29th pick in the 2023 draft and a 2024 second-round pick while Denver got Payton and a 2024 third-round pick.
ESPN spoke to more than a dozen players and coaches about playing for a man one player described as an ""offensive savant."" They shared stories of what it was like to play for Payton's ""Game-day Sean"" alter ego, how he approached the practice week and what it might look like when Payton plays his old team Thursday.
""He's certainly a demanding coach ... and he does a really good job of identifying areas of weakness that he wants to try to attack,"" Allen said. ""And so certainly that'll be something we'll have to deal with.""
PAYTON'S GLARE ISthe first thing many former players recall about their coach. Players had several names for it: ""the death stare,"" ""the look"" and the ""mean face,"" among them.
""If you mess up, you don't even want to look at him. You don't even want to be in his eye distance,"" said Saints tight endJuwan Johnson, who played for Payton from 2020 to 2021.
Players described Payton's alter ego as ""Game-day Sean"" -- alluding to the change in his personality during games.
The stories were numerous: Hedestroyed a fire alarmin the visiting locker room prior to a 51-14 win against theCincinnati Bengalsin 2018 because he ""needed the noise to stop.""He snapped at an equipment managerfor handing him the wrong stick of gum during the NFC Championship Game from the 2009 season. He once mockedMinnesota Vikingsfans by doing theSKOL clap in a playoff game.
Saints special teams coordinator Darren Rizzi, who coached for Payton from 2019 to 2021, said Payton's former assistants recently joked about how many times he fired them during a game. One coach estimated it was at least 20 times.
""I think everyone has one of those game-day stories about him, but, to his credit, he's got amnesia, when it's over, it's over,"" Rizzi said. Former Saints wide receiver Lance Moore, who played for him from 2006 to 2013, said Payton's routine used to start with Spark energy drinks. Players would guess how many he had by game time based on his level of intensity.
""We're like, how many Sparks has Sean had today?"" Moore said. ""I guarantee you that was part of his game-day persona. He gets his energy drinks in and that helps him get his level of focus and intensity ready to go.""
The biting remarks come next. Moore still remembers Payton's tirade after he dropped a pass against theGreen Bay Packersin Week 2 of the 2006 season. Payton walked over and asked if the game was ""too big for him.""
It was a pivotal moment in Moore's career because he never wanted to disappoint Payton again. Saints defensive endCameron Jordan, who played for Payton from 2011 to 2021, said ""Dancin' Lance"" showed up after that, finishing ninth in career receiving yards for the franchise.
""He brings out the best of you if you can respond to the way he coaches,"" Jordan said.
Some players responded by matching Payton's intensity and yelling right back. Former Saints tight endJimmy Graham, who played for Payton from 2010 until he was traded to theSeattle Seahawksin 2015, said they often butted heads in-game because they both cared about winning so much.
Graham and Payton got intoa shouting matchon the sideline of a 2014 preseason game after Graham was flagged twice for excessive celebration for dunking over the goal posts. TheNFL banned dunking after Grahamcaused a game delay in 2013 by knocking the crossbar askew.
He said Payton told him before the game that he could dunk to ""get that s--- out of your system,"" but by the time the game started, he'd forgotten about it. An angry Payton called him ""selfish"" on the sideline after the second dunk.
""He gets so into the game, that whatever he told you before, if it was something like that, he's not going to remember,"" Graham said.
Broncos rookie quarterbackBo Nixhas already taken some licks after Payton barked at him on the sideline during a Week 5 win against theLas Vegas Raiders. Paytonyelled at Nixfor not running a play -- an incomplete pass toTroy Franklin-- the way Payton intended. Nix yelled back, prompting former Saints tackleTerron Armsteadto write on X: ""Bo just became Sean's favorite player!""
Bo just became Sean's favorite player!https://t.co/DswevQt6fk
And no Broncos player will forget how Payton reacted after their70-20loss to theMiami Dolphinson Sept. 24, 2023. Theysurrendered a franchise recordin points and yardage total (726) -- the highest point total any NFL team had given up since 1966 and the highest yardage total since 1951.
Many who were in the postgame locker room have recounted a boiling cauldron of football shame, dread, anger and embarrassment.
In a cascade of words, many profane, that rattled concrete, a volcanic Payton screamed: ""This, this, this will never happen again. You understand? Ne-ver again.''
As one former Broncos player put it, ""He lost his f---ing s---, like he couldn't believe it happened ... he was a part of something he couldn't believe. I doubt he will ever be that mad at the team about anything more than that -- ever. I don't think he could see, he was so pissed, but he was letting people know if you're going to be around, you better fix that.''
THE ""GAME-DAY SEAN""personality doesn't last beyond the competition window.
""I have the utmost respect for him as a coach, but he is a Jekyll-Hyde type of person,"" Rizzi said.
Payton is calm and meticulous during the week, making sure every angle is covered. He looks for any edge he can get in the upcoming game, including figuring out tactics to motivate both the team and individual players.
He'd placegas cans by the lockersof older players to ask them if they have enough gas left to get through the season and put mouse traps around the facility as a warning to players to not ""eat the cheese"" -- falling into the trap of believing the media hype -- while on win streaks.
Graham was a favorite target, saying Payton liked to push his buttons because he knew he played well when he was ""pissed.""

Payton spent a week needling Graham about how he'd fare againstArizona CardinalssafetyTyrann Mathieuin a 2013 matchup.
""Sean had some DB play me one-on-one all practice. Holding me, scratching, clawing, talking shit. ... I was pissed,"" Graham recalled.
Graham said he was so amped by game time that he dominated the matchup against Mathieu and the team's top cornerback, finishing with nine catches for 134 yards. He said such tactics were ""very motivating.""
""I never shied away from the moment,"" Graham said. ""The bigger the moment, the better I played.""
But not every player adjusts to Payton's bluntness. Broncos defensive tackleMalcolm Roach, who spent four seasons with the Saints, said some players were surprised by their coach's direct feedback.
""But I think the guys who succeed with him know you always have to have somebody in your corner, who's going to tell you what you need to hear, not what they want to hear,"" Roach said. ""And he might think you need it a lot.''
Payton has a well-known distaste for comfort and entitlement, something that surfaced after the Broncos selected Nix with the 12th pick of the 2024 draft. Nix was not immediately named the starter. Payton believed it was ""something earned'' in an open competition during training camp.
""There was no way -- no way -- he would have named Bo the starter right after the draft,'' a former Payton assistant said, ""That would go against everything he believes, he would never let that young guy know that. He might think it, might believe it, might even want it and have planned for it, but he never would have told that kid right away, 'You're the starter.'''
When the first depth chart of the preseason was released, Nix was listed at the bottom of his position with the rest of the rookies. And Aug. 21, when Payton told Nixhe would start the seasonopener, he called each of the team's three quarterbacks over to him just before a practice, one at a time, to tell them of his decision.
""We didn't have cake and candles,'' he said.
Nix has appeared to respond well to Payton's tactics. Payton said after the sideline tiff that Nix ""had a little Ferris Bueller"" in him, explaining Bueller was quirky and liked to do his own thing.
The quarterback referenced the moment on his Instagram and responded by calling Payton ""Dennis,"" a nod to the ""Dennis the Menace"" nickname given to Payton by his mentor Bill Parcells.
""[The arguing] that's like a term of endearment for him,"" Jordan said. ""It's one of those last remnants of that brimstone and fire-type coach. Now it's 2024 ... people get their feelings hurt quicker now.""
A post shared by Bo Nix (@bonix10)
SAINTS PLAYERS ANDcoaches got used to Payton's intense attention to detail.
He'd notice if a player was even one inch off his mark in practice.
""Sean literally walked over to [a receiver] in practice and said, 'Not right here,'"" Jordan said, demonstrating how Payton moved the receiver. ""And I would call it maybe an inch and a half.""
According to Johnson, Payton was, ""for lack of a better term, anal. In a good way.""
Payton made a presentation to the Broncos last year prior to a midseason win against theBuffalo Billson ""Monday Night Football"" that included the elevation of the Bills' stadium relative to sea level.
He also pays close attention to the science of sleep studies. This was particularly important to him in Denver, as hours are lost when the team travels west to east. Broncos coaches have always stuck to the status quo by flying in Saturday for a Sunday game and arriving back in Denver in the wee hours of the morning after a prime-time game.
Instead, Payton had the Broncos go to Buffalo on Saturday and come home Tuesday for the Monday night game, a trip longer than theKansas City Chiefs' stint in Germany the prior week.
""Every detail matters on the field, then every detail matters around the field, in the facility, in the locker room, in the parking lot,'' Payton said. ""You just become maniacal with preparation.''
This year, Payton took the Broncos to Greenbrier Resort in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, where the Saints held training camp from 2014 to 2016. He wanted to keep the team in the Eastern time zone for Weeks 3 and 4 against theTampa Bay BuccaneersandNew York Jets. At a cost of roughly $2 million for the week, according to team sources, the Broncos spent five rain-soaked days at the Greenbrier.
The Broncos entered the road trip 0-2 and came home with two wins.
""[To] figure out what our identity is and come back home with two road wins, it was awesome,"" Broncos safetyP.J. Lockesaid.
IT'S TOO EARLYto know if the qualities that made Payton successful in New Orleans will translate to Denver, where he is currently 11-12. When Payton joined the Saints, he learned which players had those qualities by putting them through a training camp in the heat at Millsaps College in Jackson, Mississippi.
The camp included two-a-day practices in full pads, a practice banned by the NFL in the 2012 collective bargaining agreement. Saints assistant offensive line coach Jahri Evans, a recent finalist for the Pro Football Hall of Fame, said Payton started him immediately as a rookie because that camp proved ""his makeup.""
Now Payton has to figure out different ways of discovering which players fit his culture.
""It's not easy,"" Evans said. ""... You may think it may never happen again but it doesn't mean you don't try.""
Payton's Denver staff, which includes 14 employees with Saints ties, understands what it takes. Payton also made major personnel moves similar to his early New Orleans days, releasing starting quarterbackRussell Wilsoneven though it cost the team$53 million in salary capspace over the next two seasons. All-Pro safetyJustin Simmonswas also released this offseason.
""Sean was like, 'No one player is going to be bigger than what we're trying to do here,'"" Moore said of Payton's Saints days.
Thursday's game could foreshadow how the rest of the season goes for both Payton and his former assistant, Allen.
A Saints win would snap a four-game losing streak and help Allen take a step away from Payton's shadow, while a Broncos win could help put them on the road toward their first winning season since 2016.
""Everybody in this building knows who Sean Payton is and if he sees blood in water, he's going to go try and take advantage,"" Jordan said. ""That's always been his M.O.""
Jordan said he expects Payton to embrace any negative reception Thursday and use it as motivation. Regardless, Thursday's game will be another chapter in the ""Game-day Sean"" lore.
""He wants to be successful, he wants to dominate,"" former Saints running back Mark Ingram II said. ""... There's nothing like Sean Payton. He's one-of-one. That's what makes him so great. That's why he was great in New Orleans all these years and that's why he's been challenged with the task to bring Denver Broncos back to prominence. Because he can do it and that's what he's about."""

The Saints opened as 0.5-point favorites, but the line has since shifted toward the Broncos. New Orleans is dealing with the injury bug that will keep somekey players out, including wide receiversRashid ShaheedandChris Olave, with several others listed as questionable for Thursday's contest.
Denver is is coming off home loss to theLos Angeles Chargers, and the Saints have dropped four straight, including a blowout loss last week to theTampa Bay Buccaneersin which they gave up 51 points at home.
Thursday's game has the lowest point total of the week (36.5).

Tyler Fulghum explains why he's taking the Broncos with the points against the Saints.
Saints team total UNDER 17.5 points (-130)
The Saints are likely to once again be without starting quarterbackDerek Carr(doubtful, oblique), which would putSpencer Rattlerin line to make his second straight start. While Rattler had a reasonable NFL debut only four days ago, the Saints' 27 points in that game were deceptive. Their scoring drives, all of which came in the second quarter, included a punt return touchdown, a 17-yard field goal drive after an interception and a 10-yard touchdown drive after another interception.
In his last eight drives of the game, Rattler led the Saints to five punts, two interceptions and zero points scored. The Broncos are an elite defense, ranking top five in the NFL in fewest points allowed (fourth, 18.7 PPG allowed), yards allowed (fourth, 278.2 YPG) and passing yards allowed (fifth, 170.8 yards). That defense, in a short week, against a Rattler-led offense that has bet hit especially hard at the skill positions --Chris Olave(out, concussion),Alvin Kamara(questionable, hand),Rashid Shaheed(out, knee),Taysom Hill(questionable, ribs) -- likely leads to a low-scoring game for the Saints.
FromFirst Bet, published on Mondays
The number 37 is key when it comes to betting NFL totals, so let's get ahead of the pending move and lock in 37.5 now because I see this closing at 36.5 or lower. Since 2017, Thursday night totals of 40 or less are 20-7 to the under, which is a highly profitable hit rate of 74%. I know New Orleans just got torched for 51 points and 594 total yards against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday, but this Denver offense is a dink-and-dunk outfit that can't stretch the field like the Buccaneers. For those interested in the derivatives market, it's worth noting that Denver has been held scoreless in the first half of three of its six contests.

Van de Ven showed his pace at Old Trafford in September duringSpurs' 3-0win overManchester Unitedwhen he picked up the ball inside his own half before bursting through the United defence to provide an assist forBrennan Johnsonwho opened the scoring.
Wolves wingerCarlos Forbsis behind Van de Ven with a top speed of 36.6 km/h followed byNottingham Forest'sAnthony Elangawho has reached 35.9 km/h.

Emile Smith Rowe: I had to leave Arsenal for happiness,"Welcome to ESPN India Edition
Fulham'sEmile Smith Rowehas said his move fromArsenalwas the ""toughest decision"" of his career but one that was necessary for his happiness.
Smith Rowe left Arsenal for the west London club in the summer transfer window for aclub-record feeof £34 million ($44.1m).
The 24-year-old was a graduate of Arsenal's Hale End academy alongside teammateBukayo Sakaand made hisPremier Leaguedebut in the 2021-22 season, but struggled for minutes in the past two seasons.
""I can't remember an actual, exact moment,"" Smith Rowe said. ""But for the last two seasons I haven't played as much as I wanted to and it was always in the back of my mind that I wanted to be happy again.
""I wanted to be playing. Sometimes you have to think of the best for yourself. I always want to put my club first but at the same time I have to make myself happy. It was probably the toughest decision I've had to make [to leave]. But I spoke to my family and we decided it was the best thing for me.""
TheEnglandinternational struggled with injuries after initially bursting to prominence with the Arsenal first team.
""[It's] Really difficult. Definitely,"" he said when asked by the Telegraph about dealing with fitness setbacks. ""Ups and downs with injuries and then getting back fit and then not getting the opportunities that I obviously wanted.
""But at the same time Arsenal were pushing to win the league. So I had to wait and be patient. It was really tough. My family were there for me and I tried to stay as positive as I could. But it's football and these things happen.
""Coming through the academy all you want to do is just play for your club and when you are not getting the opportunities there is only so much you can take. Like I said there is no bad feelings or anything. I am still supporting them, I still talk to a few of the boys. It's all love.""
After not scoring for Arsenal since April 2022, Smith Rowe kickstarted his Fulham career with two goals and an assist in his first seven games.
""It was a relief,"" he said of finding the back of the net again. ""Just because I haven't had a feeling like in a long time.
""It's hard to explain the feeling. Just knowing that you have scored the goal and everyone is looking at you. I have really missed that feeling. It's literally addictive. You want to know what it's like tomorrow and the next day."""
Lucas Paquetá requests FA probe into alleged betting leaks,"Welcome to ESPN India Edition
West HammidfielderLucas Paquetáhas asked the English Football Association (FA) to investigate how information from its case against him over alleged breaches of betting rules has been leaked to the media.
Paquetá was charged in Maywith deliberately seeking to receive a booking during fourPremier Leaguegames in 2022 and 2023 in order for one or more persons to profit from betting.
The 27-year-old Brazilian denies the charges against him.
""I am frustrated and upset to have read recent misleading and inaccurate press articles, published in both England and Brazil, claiming to disclose information about my case,"" Paquetá said in astatement posted on social media.
""I am also concerned that, although they are false and misleading, these articles are clearly sourced from an individual close to the case. The FA proceedings are supposed to be confidential.
""I have, therefore, instructed my lawyers to write to the FA to request that they conduct a thorough investigation into how information about the case, even if inaccurate, is finding its way into the public domain."""
"Titans release safety Jamal Adams, honoring his request","Welcome to ESPN India Edition
Check out some of Jamal Adams' career highlights and stats after his release by the Tians. (0:48)
NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- TheTitanshonored three-time Pro Bowl safetyJamal Adams' request to be released, parting ways with him Thursday.
Adams signed a one-year deal with the Titans in July after he was released by theSeattle Seahawks. Joining the Titans gave Adams an opportunity to be reunited with defensive coordinator Dennard Wilson, who served as Adams' defensive backs coach when he was the No. 6 pick by theNew York Jetsin the 2017 NFL draft.
""At this point, wish Jamal all the best going forward, it just didn't work out here,"" Wilson told reporters Thursday. ""He'll have great success wherever he goes.""
While with the Titans, Adams played a total of 20 snaps in three games, including two in his Titans debut against the Jets in Week 2. Adams played a season-high 17 snaps the following week against theGreen Bay Packers. But his frustration level peaked after playing just one snap against theMiami Dolphinsin Week 4.
Adams told ESPN on Thursday that he wasn't frustrated about not being a starter, he just wanted an opportunity to contribute. So, he requested to be released.
The primary issue from the Titans' point of view was a lack of practice, according to a team source. Adams missed extensive time during training camp as he fought through a hip injury. The Titans placed Adams on the non-football injury list this past Saturday.
The veteran defensive back said he's healthy and ready to help out the next team he joins."
England's Thomas Tuchel similar to Sarina Wiegman - FA chief,"Welcome to ESPN India Edition
James Olley compares the differences between Thomas Tuchel and Gareth Southgate. (2:07)
Football Association chief Mark Bullingham has said he sees ""parallels"" betweenEnglandwomen's boss Sarina Wiegman and newly apppointed men's coach Thomas Tuchel.
Tuchel, who signed an18-month contract with Englandon Wednesday, will be hoping to repeat the success Wiegman, another non-English manager, brought to her side.
The Dutch coach led the women's team to win their first major trophy by lifting the Euro 2022 title on home soil, while Tuchel will be looking to earn the men's side to their first triumph since 1966 when he leads his team into the 2026 World Cup in the United States.
""I think Sarina would say she felt she came into a team that was ready to win and she instilled that confidence in the team and I think part of that came from the fact she was a proven winner,"" Bullinghamtold BBC 5 Live.
""Of course, we see parallels for that and that was forefront in our mind, when we were looking for a head coach, someone who could really give the team confidence and they had what it takes to win.""
Tuchel, who will begin work on Jan. 1, said he believes England areready to winanother major trophy.
""I think it's just nuances, it's just details,"" he told a news conference on Wednesday. ""If you lose on penalties in a final, who would I be to say I know what you did wrong when you were there.
""You were there. We or they have been in two finals I think. Semifinals and quarterfinals. Lost each of them very, very close, each of them could have gone either way. The genuine belief is that we are there, that we are ready."""

Nedum Onuoha and Julien Laurens discuss Erik ten Hag's future at Man United after club executives met in London. (1:49)
David Beckham has backed minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe to bring necessary change toManchester United, but admitted it could take time for the club to return to the top.
United have not won thePremier Leaguetitle since Beckham's former manager Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013 and last season recorded their worst-ever Premier League finish, coming eighth.
But the sporting structure at Old Trafford has been overhauled under Ratcliffe since becoming a minority owner in February and Beckham said those changes were sorely needed.
""I think that it definitely needed change,"" Beckham told his former United andEnglandteammateRio Ferdinand on his ""Rio Ferdinand Presents"" podcast. ""Speaking as a United fan, I think that many people had said that the club needed change and it needed a fresh perspective in how this club needs to be run and the decisions that are made.
""I really like Jim [Ratcliffe]. I've met him a few times over the years with a few mutual friends and I think that he's a fan and obviously he's a great businessman as well, one of the best and one of the biggest. But I think more importantly the fans see that he cares, and I think that that's a big part of it.
""I think obviously the fans had lost faith with the leadership over the years and obviously he really cares about what he wants to do and what he wants to create. So, hopefully, things will change but these things take time. These things take time.
""I think we have been quite patient as United fans over the years, but we want those good old days back. We want those days back, and the sooner the better.""
While United have continued to struggle this season, Beckham has enjoyed much greater success with his own team,Inter Miami. The club has already claimed the Supporters' Shield as MLS' best regular-season team and on Saturday could break the all-time record for most points in a single season.
The team has been led byArgentinagreatLionel Messi. And Beckham said that he took some inspiration from Ferguson when bringing the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner to Miami last year.
""I think that one of the things that I learned from the boss over the years -- and it wasn't something that he specifically told me -- one of the things that I learned from the boss was it's not about bringing the biggest and best players, it's about bringing the right players.
""If you can bring the biggest and best players that is the right player. There's not many of them around, but with Leo we knew that we were bringing and I knew that, yes he was going to be successful on the field but I also knew that he was going to help our club off the field."""
"Lonzo Ball scores 10 in return, reflects on rehab: 'All behind me now'","Welcome to ESPN India Edition
CHICAGO -- AsLonzo Ballchecked into his first NBA game in more than 2½ years Wednesday night, the United Center crowd serenaded him with a standing ovation. He threw his hands in the air and tapped his heart, acknowledging the crowd before playing for the first time since Jan. 14, 2022.
Ball was restricted to 15 minutes, but finished with 10 points on 4-of-6 shooting from the field in Chicago's 125-123 preseason victory against Minnesota.
""Felt a lot better playing than watching,"" Ball said after the game. ""I couldn't even put it into words how it felt being out there. ... It was definitely a moment I'll never forget.""
Since playing in his last NBA game more than 1,000 days ago, Ball has undergone three arthroscopic procedures on his left knee, including a rare double cartilage transplant in March 2023.
""Long. Really long,"" Ball said with a laugh of his recovery process. ""But looking back on it, it went a lot faster than I thought. ... Them telling me 18 more months recovery [after the third surgery], it sounds crazy in the moment, but now I'm here. It's all behind me now.""
Earlier Wednesday, Ball said he was ""full of joy"" to be preparing for a game again but also acknowledged he would not be the same player he was when he last took the court for a game.
""It's not the same body I started off with,"" Ball said after Wednesday's shootaround. ""But I think I can still be productive and effective on the court. That's why I'm still trying to play.""
And Wednesday night, Ball made an impact every time he stepped on the court. He knocked down his first shot, a corner 3-pointer, and then threw up three fingers as he ran up the court. He stole the ball fromJulius Randleon another possession and dove into the Bulls bench to save it from going out of bounds.
In his first season in Chicago in 2021-22, Ball averaged 13.0 points, 5.4 rebounds and 5.1 assists on 42% shooting in 35 games. And in his first game back, he did a little bit of everything on the court: collecting one block, one steal, one assist and one rebound.
""I thought he looked great,"" Bulls coach Billy Donovan said. ""There's a lot of things he does in the game that he doesn't really require anything with his knee or his body, he uses his brain so much. He moved really, really well.""
And most importantly for both he and the Bulls, he wasn't thinking about his knee while playing.
""That's a positive thing,"" Ball said. ""I didn't feel it at all. I felt like I was moving great. So now it's just about building, just continue to do it night and night out.""
Donovan said the Bulls would monitor Ball's knee to see how it reacted to his first game action, and he was almost certain to have a light day in practice Thursday. Ball said he also planned to play in Friday's preseason finale against theCleveland Cavaliers.
""I think he's going to need to play,"" Donovan said. ""That's kind of the normal NBA rhythm, playing every other day.""
Throughout the recovery process, Ball, who will turn 27 later this month, remained confident he'd return to the court, seeking opinions from multiple knee specialists until he found a path to recovery.
""I think it's the belief in myself -- knowing what I was feeling, knowing that I was a good age to come back from it,"" Ball said. ""I'm just trusting in the doctors and people around me.""
By August, Ball was cleared to play in 5-on-5 scrimmages. He arrived at the Bulls' facility a few weeks ahead of training camp to begin working out with the rest of the team. He had expected to make his preseason debut earlier in the schedule, but he was set back a few days after testing positive for COVID-19.
Ball has also had bouts of soreness throughout the preseason, which he said was to be expected. He emphasized both he and the team would have to manage his workload and playing time this season.
""We have a good handle right now, but I think it's going to change throughout the year,"" Ball said. ""Every day is going to be a different challenge we just have to overcome."""
Sabrina Ionescu secures Liberty Game 3 win vs. Lynx in WNBA Finals,"Welcome to ESPN India Edition
MINNEAPOLIS --Sabrina Ionescuhad to watch video in the locker room of her winning 3-pointer Wednesday night to know just how long it was. But she said that as soon as she launched it, she thought, ""Yeah, this is in.""
Ionescu's 28-foot dagger that swished with 1 second left -- ""definitely the biggest shot of my career"" -- gave theNew York Libertyan80-77 come-from-behind winover theMinnesota Lynxin Game 3 of the WNBA Finals. The Liberty are now one victory away from their first league title in franchise history.
""I would say I visualize a lot when I'm practicing in the offseason, the night before a game, the day of a game,"" Ionescu said. ""I'm always visualizing different scenarios and putting myself in tough situations. Obviously, I didn't play my best tonight, but finding a way to continue to stick with it ... I feel like that's been a big growth for me, whether the ball is going in or not.""
This one went in, the 10th 3-pointer of the game for the Liberty. Ionescu's shot left the Lynx's record crowd of 19,521 stunned, much like Minnesota did to the New York crowd in Game 1, a 95-93 Lynx win in overtime.
The Liberty lost an 18-point lead in that game; the Lynx lost a 15-point edge Wednesday. In both cases, there were dramatic momentum shifts and huge plays in the kind of heavyweight matchup expected when the top two seeds play for a championship.
""The hardest thing to do when we're in a series ... is there's so many ups and downs and swings,"" Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve said, ""and it takes special mental toughness and physical toughness to weather those swings. We're disappointed -- we're home, we played well and just couldn't come up with the win.
""We have to dust ourselves off and get another crack at it here at home. We'll see what we can do on Friday.""
The teams will return to Target Center with the Lynx trying to send the series back to New York for a deciding Game 5 on Sunday. Minnesota has an uphill battle, but it has been done before. Four other teams have won the WNBA title after being down 2-1 in the Finals, including the Lynx in 2017.
The Liberty want to end the series Friday. They are one of three original WNBA teams still in the city where they started; the other two, theLos Angeles SparksandPhoenix Mercury, each have won three titles.
This was the fourth go-ahead 3-pointer in the final 5 seconds of a game in WNBA Finals history, and the first since Maya Moore in 2015. It was the first by the Liberty since 1999, when Teresa Weatherspoon hit ""The Shot.""
New York has played for the championship five times before this year. One of the most dramatic of those series losses was in 1999, when the Liberty won Game 2 of what was then a best-of-three series at Houston on Teresa Weatherspoon's shot at the buzzer from beyond half court, only to lose the next day to the Comets.
Weatherspoon's shot, often cited as the most famous in league history, is one of four times that a WNBA player has made a winning 3-pointer in the last 5 seconds of a Finals game. The others were Minnesota's Maya Moore in Game 3 in 2015 againstIndiana, and Los Angeles'Nikki Teasleyin Game 2 in 2002 against New York.
Teasley's shot won that series in what was then still a best-of-three Finals. Moore and Minnesota lost Game 4 of the 2015 Finals, but then won Game 5 and the title.
So Ionescu is the fourth player to pull off this feat, and it came in a game that was eerily similar to New York's victory when Weatherspoon made her shot 25 years ago. The Liberty led for just 2 minutes, 19 seconds Wednesday, the second-shortest amount of time leading in a Finals win in WNBA history.
The shortest time to lead in a Finals win? You guessed it: Game 2 of the 1999 Finals, when the Liberty led the Comets for just 2:15 before Weatherspoon's buzzer-beater.
Trying to win a long-awaited championship for New York has been on Ionescu's mind since she was drafted No. 1 in 2020 in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic that cancelled the NCAA tournament her senior season atOregon.
Ionescu then suffered a season-ending ankle injury in her third Liberty game. She left the WNBA's COVID-19 bubble in Bradenton, Florida, and went home to California to rehab. Ionescu said she couldn't bring herself to watch many Liberty games on television the rest of that season, as the team finished 2-20.
Then, before the 2023 season, she was joined by free agentsBreanna StewartandCourtney Vandersloot, andJonquel Jones, who arrived via trade. Those players and Ionescu helped form the core of the team that is playing in its second consecutive WNBA Finals.
The Liberty lost 3-1 to theLas Vegas Aceslast season, but the players said they learned a lot about themselves in the process. This season, New York had the best record in the regular season (32-8) and is the No. 1 seed.
The Liberty didn't look like it in the first quarter Wednesday. Contrary to fast starts in the first two games of the Finals, the Liberty trailed 28-18 after the first quarter. They cut the deficit to 43-35 by halftime.
In the third quarter, though, Stewart took over, scoring 14 points and bringing New York to within 62-61. The Lynx defense was hampered somewhat by forwardAlanna Smithdealing with a back injury she suffered in the second quarter. She still played nearly 20 minutes but was clearly in pain.
Stewart previously won WNBA titles in 2018 and 2020 with the team that drafted her No. 1 in 2016, theSeattle Storm. Now playing for the team in her home state of New York, Stewart had a tough finish to Game 1 when she missed a free throw at the end of regulation and a layup at the end of overtime.
Since then, though, Stewart has come back strong. Along with her game-high 30 points Wednesday, she had 11 rebounds and 4 blocks.
""We don't win this game without Stewie,"" Ionescu said.
Ionescu, Jones andLeonie Fiebicheach finished with 13 points.
Ionescu was named to the All-WNBA second team earlier Wednesday; some thought she should have been on the first team.
""That was just a great All-WNBA second-team performance,"" Ionescu joked after the game.
New York coach Sandy Brondello said even if Ionescu was 4-of-11 from the field before the winning shot, she never doubted for a minute she should take it.
""Obviously, Stewie got us back in there, willed us in there,"" Brondello said. ""But I thought, '[At] the right time, this is Sabrina.' She's a great shooter.
""What I love about her is that she backs herself. Not everyone can take those big shots and make them. She can.""

Olympics,"Welcome to ESPN India Edition
India at the Olympics has quite the history, with medals dating back to pre-Independence in 1900. India has won a total of 40 medals from 26 modern Games.
While this isn't the most impressive of hauls, ranking India as 57th in the all-time table, it makes every medal precious to a nation of over 1.5 billion.
Note: India has never won a Winter Olympics medal - all 38 have come at the Summer Olympics. India also did not participate in the 1896, 1904, 1908 and 1912 Summer Olympics.
Here is every medal won by India at the Olympics.
India made their debut at the 1900 Paris Olympics, despite being under British rule. Norman Pritchard, born in Calcutta, was the lone athlete representing India - according to the International Olympic Council, although this is disputed in other historical records. Pritchard won two silver medals to kick off India's medal tally.
Norman Pritchard - SILVER - Men's 200m hurdles
Norman Pritchard - SILVER - Men's 200m sprint
India won their first-ever gold medal at the Olympics in men's hockey. Dhyan Chand led a dominant team to gold, kicking off a streak of six consecutive gold medals.
India men's hockey team - GOLD - Field hockey
India secured their biggest ever win (24-1 vs USA) en route to their second consecutive gold in men's hockey.
India men's hockey team - GOLD - Field hockey
Dhyan Chand made it a hat-trick of gold medals for India, defeating Germany in the men's hockey final.
India men's hockey team - GOLD - Field hockey
India won their first-ever Olympic medal as an independent nation, with no surprise as to its origin. A new generation of hockey players lead by Balbir Singh Sr. continued India's dominance.
India men's hockey team - GOLD - Field hockey
The Indian men's hockey team made it five in a row, with Balbir Singh Sr. increasing his legend with a superb performance in the final. India also won their first-ever medal in wrestling, with KD Jadhav earning independent India's first-ever individual medal.
India men's hockey team - GOLD - Field hockey
KD Jadhav - BRONZE - Men's wrestling (bantamweight)
Balbir Singh Sr. and his band of merry men made it six gold medals in a row for the Indian men's hockey team - an Olympic feat not bettered in a team event apart from USA's basketball teams.
India men's hockey team - GOLD - Field hockey
India reached double digits in their Olympic medal tally but it wasn't a gold in men's hockey as expected, with a Balbir Singh Sr. - less India losing to Pakistan in the final.
India men's hockey team - SILVER - Field hockey
The Indian men's hockey team faced Pakistan in the final for a third consecutive time but won gold this time.
India men's hockey team - GOLD - Field hockey
The Indian men's hockey team failed to reach the final for the first time in the last eight Olympics, losing in the semifinal to Australia and then beating West Germany to win bronze.
India men's hockey team - BRONZE - Field hockey
India made it 10 consecutive medals for the men's hockey team, as well as the nation, which went medal-less in 1976. A loss to Pakistan in the semifinal was followed by a win over Netherlands to win bronze.
India men's hockey team - BRONZE - Field hockey
The Indian men's hockey team returned to the summit, after a catastrophic 1976 Olympics and won gold. It would be Indian hockey's last medal until the bronze in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
India men's hockey team - GOLD - Field hockey
After 14 medals in the previous 15 Olympics, India's run came to a hard stop in the next three, going medal-less in 1984, 1988 and 1992. Leander Paes ended the 16-year drought with a shock bronze in tennis, losing to Andre Agassi in the semifinal before beating Fernando Meligani to earn India's 15th Olympic medal and only the third individual medal.
Leander Paes - Bronze - Men's singles, Tennis
Weightlifter Karnam Malleswari became the first Indian woman to win an Olympic medal, and only the fourth individual medal in the nation's history.
Karnam Malleswari - BRONZE - Women's weightlifting (54kg)
Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore won India's sole medal at the Athens Olympics and became the first Indian shooter to win an Olympic medal.
Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore - SILVER - Men's double trap shooting
India won three medals at an Olympics for the first-time ever, with Abhinav Bindra, Vijender Singh and Sushil Kumar making it India's then most successful Olympics and taking the nation's tally to 20. Bindra's gold was India's first-ever individual gold medal, while Vijender Singh won India's first boxing medal at the Olympics.
Abhinav Bindra - GOLD - Men's 10m air rifle shooting
Vijender Singh - BRONZE - Men's middleweight boxing
Sushil Kumar - BRONZE - Men's wrestling (freestyle 66kg)
India doubled their best-ever tally at the Olympics, with six medals taking their overall tally to 26. Saina Nehwal won India's first-ever badminton medal, with five-time world champion Mary Kom becoming the first Indian woman to win a boxing medal (only because this was the first edition of women's boxing at the Olympics). Sushil Kumar also became the first Indian to win two individual Olympic medals.
Gagan Narang - BRONZE - Men's 10m air rifle shooting
Vijay Kumar - SILVER - Men's 25m rapid fire pistol shooting
Saina Nehwal - BRONZE - Women's singles, Badminton
Mary Kom - BRONZE - Women's flyweight boxing
Yogeshwar Dutt - BRONZE - Men's wrestling (freestyle 60kg)
Sushil Kumar - SILVER - Men's wrestling (freestyle 66kg)
India were swiftly brought back down to earth after the success of London, with only two medals in Brazil. PV Sindhu won her first Olympic medal, while Sakshi Malik became the first (and till date, only) Indian woman wrestler to win an Olympic medal.
Sakshi Malik - BRONZE - Women's wrestling (58kg)
PV Sindhu - SILVER - Women's singles, Badminton
The Covid-affected Olympics proved to be India's most successful ever, with seven medals taking India's overall tally to 35 medals. PV Sindhu became the first Indian woman to win multiple Olympic medals, while the Indian men's hockey team ended their 41-year medal drought. Neeraj Chopra won the nation's first-ever gold medal in Athletics (and only the second individual gold ever by an Indian).
Mirabai Chanu - SILVER - Women's weightlifting (49kg)
PV Sindhu - BRONZE - Women's singles, Badminton
Lovlina Borgohain - BRONZE - Women's welterweight boxing
India men's hockey team - BRONZE - Field hockey

Neeraj Chopra - GOLD - Men's javelin throw
The ongoing Paris Olympics saw shooting end a 12-year drought, while Manu Bhaker became the first to win multiple medals at the same Games (Independent India). Neeraj Chopra became the fourth individual Indian to have multiple medals at the Olympics
Manu Bhaker - BRONZE - Women's 10m pistol shooting
Manu Bhaker and Sarabjot Singh - BRONZE - Mixed team 10m pistol shooting
Swapnil Kusale - BRONZE - Men's 50m air rifle 3P shooting

ESPN India Awards 2023: Full list of winners,"Welcome to ESPN India Edition
From the glorious highs to the lowest lows, Indian sport has seen its share of drama this year. The jewels in the 2022 crown were a historic Thomas Cup and one of India's best ever Commonwealth Games outings but there was so much more. We attempt to capture, and herald, the best of the year.
Here are ESPN India's Awards (and Moments), 2022:
Everything Neeraj all at once
Neeraj Chopra completed a special full circle in sport in 2023 and off the track, Neeraj showed us he was not just a champion athlete but a champion human too. It was so improbable; it was like a movie script. And so -- for this one time only -- we've abandoned our usual format and gone the filmi route, giving Neeraj awards in multiple main categories -Shyam Vasudevan
With consistent excellence, Jyothi Surekha Vennam keeps setting the targets for Indian archery
Even before her exploits 2023, Jyothi Surekha Vennam was one of the India's leading compound archers with slew of medals at the World Championships, World Cup and Asian Games. But this was the year she firmly established her credentials as India's most consistent and best in a sport that is often sidelines as a step-sibling to the Olympic discipline of recurve archery -Zenia D'cunha
Anas, Amoj, Ajmal, Rajesh - Unlikely Indian relay stars shine on the big stage
India were gold medallists at the Asian Games in the men's relay 4x400 once again, although this came after 61 years. A quartet of disparate individuals who came together in 2023 and through teamwork and trust, their whole became greater than the sum of its parts -Sunaadh Sagar
Sergio Pagni sculpts golden 2023 for Indian compound archery
Five out of five golds at the Asian Games (and a silver and a bronze). Three golds and a bronze at the World Championships (where India had never won gold before in its 92-year history). Sergio Pagni has presided over the single most productive year Indian archery has ever seen -Anirudh Menon
Sumit Antil breaks barriers to go where no one has gone before
Breaking world records and smashing the competition has now become a norm for Sumit Antil: who didn't go into the Asian Para Games targeting just gold, but breaking his own world record. Which he did -Anish Anand
Mukherjee and Mukherjee live the impossible dream
The word miracle is often overused in sporting contexts. However, in this context, Sutirtha Mukherjee and Ayhika Mukherjee needed something more than just a mere miracle: and they dug it out -Aaditya Narayan
Sheetal Devi, Aditi Swami and Kishore Jena emerge into Indian sports' spotlight in 2023
It's perhaps the best part of sport - an unheralded name making a breakthrough and being catapulted into the spotlight -Anish Anand, Zenia D'Cunha, Shyam Vasudevan
As a remarkable 2023 draws to end, ESPN India picks ten images that tell the story of the most extraordinary Indian sports moments witnessed over the year.
India's wrestlers, beaten by police, carried the flag and their fight against the system
Vinesh Phogat and Sangeeta Phogat on the road, arms clasped around each other. Sangeeta on her back, Vinesh on top of her, shielding her from the police personnel in flak jackets and boots. The flag of the Republic of India on a stick, in their hands, on the road. -Anirudh Menon
Kanteerava singing 'Vande Mataram' permeates into Indian football history
That single frame of the crowd singing the modern version of the national song encapsulated the positivity around the team (at the time), and the sport's ever-increasing popularity as the summer of success fed both the loyalist and the newly converted with the kind of adrenaline rush that everyone craves. - Anirudh Menon
Praggnanandhaa, Nagalakshmi and the mother's smile that resonated across India
This one image had crystallised the hopes of many Indians and given voice to their desires. To make true that old Tamil proverb: ""The mother who hears her son called 'a wise man' will rejoice more than she did at his birth."" -Sunaadh Sagar
India vs Iran went from Kabaddi epic to embarrassment
This was supposed to be a spectacle. The two best Kabaddi teams in the world. Two teams who know each other so well. At the highest stage, this was supposed to be the best advertisement for it. Instead, it descended into a farce. -Aaditya Narayan
Sheetal Devi finds perfection, despite all the odds
It shouldn't be counted only as one of this year's best sporting moments, this deserves a place in India's sporting history. -Anish Anand
Vukomanovic's unprecedented walkout followed by (even more) unprecedented support
Everything about the walkout was unprecedented, but perhaps the most surprising outcome from it has been how the Blasters faithful have rallied behind their 'Aashaan' -Aaditya Narayan
Parul Chaudhary surges past stereotypes and competition to win big
The frame at the finish line encapsulated the mood: Parul, arms lofted and outstretched palms, almost saying ""Hey, I got this."" If there was a frame to say, ""Make way, the champion is here"" this would be it. -Shyam Vasudevan
One small jump for Neeraj, a giant leap for Indian javelin
In the end that jump onto the podium was something Indian sports fans have gotten used to, but it was all that went into making that jump that made it oh, so special -Anish Anand
Jyothi Yarraji stands her ground to win sensational silver
There she stood, with hands on her hips and a razor-sharp gaze boring into the official. Jyothi Yarraji had just been disqualified from the women's 100m hurdles final at the Asian Games. The biggest race of her career -Shyam Vasudevan
Golden Sat-Chi bow down to their gurus
But there was something unique about how Sat-Chi celebrated when they did something no Indian ever had at an Asian Games: win a badminton gold medal -Zenia D'Cunha"

ESPN.in's best of the decade,"Welcome to ESPN India Edition
2009-2019 was quite the decade in Indian sport. We here at ESPN celebrate the best of the best as we get ready to usher in the 2020s:
Sharda Ugra looks back at the odyssey of Indian sport through the decade, which has been in sync with PV Sindhu's progression.
PV Sindhu is easily the best Indian sportsperson of the last 10 years. She has, after all, ticked nearly every box there is in her sport, writes Jonathan Selvaraj.
From best-ever medal tallies at major events to world champions across multiple sports, we attempt to sum up Indian sport in the past decade through memes.
ESPN brings you the most magical moments in Indian sports over the last decade, in the words of the athletes who created them.
At four feet eleven inches, Dutee Chand may appear to be a misfit, but she is, and always will be, bigger than her sport. Susan Ninan writes.
The 2010s were arguably the most successful in Indian sport. Who were the five athletes that stood out? Mohit Shah writes.
Know your alphabet? Think again, as ESPN takes you through the last 10 years in Indian sport.
What were the best lines of the 2010s? ESPN brings you a selection of the finest quotes from India's superstar athletes.
From Sunil Chhetri's 53 international goals to PV Sindhu's five World Championships medals, Debayan Sen and Manoj Bhagavatula bring you the best numbers from the decade gone by.
That India have won two Olympic medals and nine Worlds medals in badminton over the past decade is mostly thanks to Pullela Gopichand, writes Debdatta Sengupta.
No one team has grabbed Indian sport by the scruff of its collective collar like Bengaluru FC, writes Anirudh Menon.
Aamir Khan, Madhavan, Soubin Sahar, and Anurag Kashyap all feature as our staff pick their five favourite Indian sports films of the decade.
Debayan Sen gives you a chance to test your memory. How much can you get correct?"

        "headline": "Jailed PKK leader tells group to lay down arms, end conflict with Turkiye",
        "body": "In a historic move, Abdullah Ocalan has asked his party to ‘lay down arms’ and dissolve itself, according to a statement.\nThe jailed leader of Turkiye’s outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) Abdullah Ocalan has made a historic call for the party to lay down its arms, dissolve itself and end its decades-long conflict with the Turkish state.\nA delegation of Turkiye’s pro-Kurdish DEM Party on Thursday visited the island prison where Ocalan has been held since 1999 and later delivered his statement in nearby Istanbul.\n“I am making a call for the laying down of arms, and I take on the historical responsibility of this call,” Ocalan said in the letter.\n“Convene your [party] congress and make a decision. All groups must lay down their arms and the PKK must dissolve itself,” Ocalan said, according to the statement.\nThe PKK is deemed a “terrorist” organisation by Turkiye and its Western allies.\nCommenting on the move, ruling AK Party Deputy Chairman Efkan Ala said that his country will be “free of its shackles” if the PKK lays down arms and dissolves.\nIn the first response from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s ruling party, Ala said the government expected the PKK to comply with Ocalan’s call.\nAl Jazeera’s Sinem Koseoglu, reporting from Istanbul, said Ocalan’s letter carries “historical importance” as it is the first time he is asking the PKK to dissolve itself.\nThis makes the DEM Party “more significant in Turkish politics”, Koseoglu said.\n\n\n\nIn his letter, Ocalan explained his decision by saying that the PKK had been formed during a period where the Turkish state restricted Kurdish rights, but that Kurdish identity was no longer denied in Turkiye, and there had been “improvements in freedom of expression”.\nTurkiye has in recent decades removed restrictions on the use of the Kurdish language and the free expression of Turkish identity, particularly since the AK Party came to power in 2002. However, detractors say that the state has not gone far enough in granting more rights for Kurds in Turkiye.\n“Respect for identities, free self-expression, democratic self-organisation of each segment of society based on their own socio-economic and political structures, are only possible through the existence of a democratic society and political space,” Ocalan said in his letter.\nThe PKK launched its fight against the Turkish state in 1984. Its aim was an independent homeland for Kurds in southeastern Turkiye, but has since officially moved away from separatist goals, instead calling for more autonomy. However, it did not renounce armed violence, and groups affiliated with the PKK have continued to carry out sporadic attacks in Turkiye.\nIn October,the PKK claimed responsibility for an attackon a Turkish state-run defence company near Ankara, that killed five people and wounded 22 others. In response, Turkiye struck PKK targets in Iraq and Syria.\nTurkiye regularly conducts air attacks against the PKK in Iraq and against affiliated groups in Syria.\nThe appeal from Ocalan could have implications for the major oil-exporting region of northern Iraq, where the PKK is based, and for neighbouring Syria, which is emerging after 13 years of civil war and the ouster in December of President Bashar Al-Assad.\nThe president of the Kurdistan Regional Government in northern Iraq, Nechirvan Barzani, welcomed Ocalan’s message, while in Syria, Mazloum Abdi, the head of the Syrian Democratic Forces – many of whose leadership is affiliated with the PKK – said that Ocalan’s statement was “historic”, but was “not related to us in Syria”.\nA Turkiye-PKK peace process collapsed a decade ago.\nOcalan, 75, has been imprisoned on the island of Imrali, off Istanbul, since 1999 after being convicted of treason. Despite his incarceration, he continues to wield significant influence over the PKK and the group’s leadership is widely expected to heed any of his calls.\nOcalan’s momentous announcement is part of a new effort for peace between the group and the Turkish state, which was initiated in October by President Erdogan’s coalition partner, Devlet Bahceli. The nationalist politician suggested that Ocalan could be granted parole if his group renounces violence and disbands.\nLast year, Ocalan said he could shift the Kurdish question “from an arena of conflict and violence to one of law and politics”, later offering assurances he was “ready to take the necessary steps and make the call”.\nThursday’s meeting was the third time DEM Party officials have met with Ocalan as part of the peace efforts. The officials have also met with Selahattin Demirtas, an imprisoned former leader of the DEM Party’s predecessor, and travelled to Iraq for talks with Kurdish leaders there.\nThe DEM Party has had to change its name after it was repeatedly banned. Opponents say the party supports “PKK terrorism”, but DEM says it is calling for greater democracy in Turkiye, and say the shutdown of DEM’s predecessors and the imprisonment of Demirtas is evidence of a crackdown against Turkiye’s pro-Kurdish movement.\nGalip Dalay, senior consulting fellow at Chatham House, says if successful, the move would be one of the “most transformative events that have happened in the Middle East”.\nIt could “redefine the course of Turkish politics” and would also “redefine Turkiye’s relationship with the region’s Kurds in the main neighbouring states”, Dalay told Al Jazeera.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

        "body": "Rebel commander Corneille Nangaa says 65 people wounded in blasts as DRC’s presidency blames ‘a foreign army’.\nAt least 11 people have been killed and 65 wounded when explosions rocked the city of Bukavu in the easternDemocratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)during a rally for the M23 rebel group and their supporters, the leader of the rebel alliance says.\nThe DRC’s presidency, which says neighbouring Rwanda is backing the rebels, said in a post on X that “several” deaths occurred on Thursday and blamed “a foreign army illegally present on Congolese soil”.\nCorneille Nangaa – who is the leader of the Congo River Alliance, which includes M23, and who had himself been present at the rally – said grenades were used in the explosions and were the same type used by Burundi’s army in the DRC. His claims could not be verified.\nThe first explosion caused panic, sending attendees fleeing from the area before a second explosion rang out, according to the AFP news agency. Residents said the explosions were accompanied by gunfire.\nPeople ran through the streets, some bleeding and carrying limp bodies, video showed. Residents said they saw dead people.\nThe meeting was the first to be attended by Nangaa since his forces seized control of Bukavu, the region’s second largest city, nearly two weeks ago.\nNangaa told the Reuters news agency by phone that neither he nor other senior rebel commanders were wounded in the attack.\n\n\n\nBukavu is one of two key cities in the turbulent region seized in recent weeks by antigovernmentM23 fighters, who United Nations experts said are backed by Rwanda.\nThe armed group has been trying to demonstrate that it can restore order in the territory it has captured from the DRC’s army and has reopened ports and schools.\nM23 fighters have swept through the eastern DRC, seizing key cities and killing about 7,000 people. There have also been reports ofsexual abuse of childrenand recruitment of minors as soldiers.\nThe rebel advance has stirred fears of a regional war that could draw in the DRC’s neighbours, including Rwanda.\nThe advance has been described as the gravest escalation in more than a decade of the long-running conflict in the eastern DRC, which is rooted in the spillover of Rwanda’s 1994 genocide into the DRC and the struggle for control of the DRC’s vast mineral resources.\nRwanda has said it is defending itself against the threat from a Hutu militia, which it said is fighting with the Congolese military.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

        "headline": "Andrew Tate and brother arrive in US after Romania travel ban lifted",
        "body": "Romanian prosecutors confirm travel ban lifted as court rules to lift seizure of multiple assets.\nRight-wing influencer brothers Andrew and Tristan Tate, who are under investigation in Romania on allegtions including human trafficking, have arrived in the United States after authorities lifted travel restrictions imposed on the pair as part of the case.\nThe brothers, who have dual United Kingdom and US citizenship, left Romania’s capital Bucharest on Thursday morning on board a private jet bound for Florida, as Romanian anti-organised crime agency DIICOT said it had approved “a request to modify” their travel ban.\nRomanian prosecutorsdetainedformer kickboxer Andrew Tate, 38, and his brother Tristan, 36, in 2022, accusing them of setting up a criminal organisation in Romania and the UK in 2021, human trafficking, trafficking of minors, sexual intercourse with a minor and money laundering. They deny all the allegations.\nDIICOT said in a statement that the Tates remained “under judicial supervision” and still had to respond to any summons from judicial authorities, with violations “in bad faith” liable to be punished with a “higher custodial measure”.\nA court in Bucharest also ruled in favour of an appeal by the Tates to lift the seizure of multiple assets, according to the brothers’ spokesperson, Mateea Petrescu.\nThe assets include six luxury vehicles, land and properties, and company shares. All previously frozen bank accounts have been unfrozen, she said.\n“While some assets remain under precautionary seizure, this ruling marks a significant step toward justice,” she said.\nThe Tates’ arrival in the US comes after Romania’s Foreign Minister Emil Hurezeanu said that the brothers were mentioned during his brief hallway meeting with US President Donald Trump’s special envoy Richard Grenell at the Munich Security Conference earlier this month.\nHe denied he had faced pressure to lift the travel ban on the Tates, after the Financial Times newspaper cited sources claiming that members of the Trump administration had pressed Bucharest to remove the restrictions.\nCristi Danilet, a former judge in Romania’s northern city of Cluj, said that any bilateral agreement on lifting the “preventative measure” would be unprecedented.\n“If it is true, it means that there is no more rule of law and sovereign countries,” he said.\n\n\n\nRomanian authorities formally indicted the Tates along with two Romanian women last year. All four deny the allegations.\nA first criminal case failed in December when the Bucharest court of appeals decided not to start the trial and sent the files back to prosecutors citing flaws in the indictment.\nIn April, another court, the Bucharest Tribunal, ruled that a trial could start but didn’t set a date.\nPending the completion of the ongoing criminal investigation, the Tates are under judicial control, a light preventative measure under which they are required to check in with the police at regular intervals.\nABritish arrest warranton allegations of sexual aggression between 2012 and 2015 has also been issued for the Tates, who were set to be extradited after Romanian trial proceedings.\nIn a joint statement on Thursday, the four British women who brought the allegations expressed “disbelief”, saying there was now “a major risk” that criminal proceedings in Romania would be halted and calling on the authorities to “take action … to ensure he faces justice in the UK”.\nA spokesperson for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s office declined to comment on the situation or whether the UK wanted to see Tate extradited to the UK.\nA self-described misogynist, social media influencer Tate has gained millions of fans by promoting an ultra-masculine lifestyle that critics say denigrates women.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

        "headline": "Mystery disease kills more than 50 in DRC: What we know so far",
        "body": "Officials have ruled out Ebola or Marburg virus, but say those infected are presenting symptoms of a ‘hemorrhagic fever’.\nA mysterious viral disease has emerged in parts of western Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in recent weeks, resulting in at least 53 deaths, officials say.\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), clinicians are particularly concerned about the short period between the onset of what appear to be symptoms of a “hemorrhagic fever” and death – around just 48 hours – prompting fears that there could be a high number of deaths if the outbreak continues.\nThis is the latest viral epidemic to hit the East African region in the past year, following outbreaks of Marburg and mpox diseases among others.\nThe DRC, in particular, is susceptible to epidemics because of its tropical climate, in which pathogens thrive, as well as its dense forests which expose people to wildlife likely to carry diseases. Many viral diseases in the country, and elsewhere, have also been linked to consumption of the meat of wild animals.\nHere’s what we know about the latest viral threat:\nThe new virus was first detected in January, in a remote village called Boloko, in DRC’s Equateur Province. It occurred in three children who had eaten a dead bat, according to WHO. All three of the children, aged under five years old, died within 48 hours of presenting symptoms including fever, chills and headaches, between January 10 and 13.\nFour more deaths were recorded in the same village among children between the ages of five and 18, all with similar symptoms, in late January. One death, on January 22, was recorded in the nearby village of Danda.\nOn February 9, a second outbreak of the disease was recorded in Bomate, a separate town some distance away.\nBy February 15, 431 cases had been recorded with 53 deaths in total according to WHO (PDF), which said the fatality rate was 10.7 percent. About half of the deaths were recorded within 48 hours of the symptoms’ onset.\nAccording to the WHO, symptoms of the disease suggest it belongs to a group of diseases called viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHF), meaning they cause excessive sickness and blood loss. Recognised examples of such diseases include Ebola, Lassa fever and Marburg virus.\nSymptoms recorded so far of the unknown disease in the DRC include fever, chills, headache, body aches, sweating, runny nose, neck stiffness, cough, vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal cramps.\nAccording to WHO, it’s not clear exactly what the cause of the disease is, or how the virus is transmitted. No clear link between the two outbreak points has been established yet. In a report, WHO said the lack of an obvious connection between the two hotspots could “suggest two separate health events”.\nMajor concerns, according to WHO, are that a “severe infectious or toxic agent” – that is, a naturally occurring virus – could be involved, and that the disease so far presents with an “exceptionally high” fatality rate.\n“Key challenges [also] include the rapid progression of the disease, with nearly half of the deaths occurring within 48 hours of symptom onset in one of the affected health zones, and an exceptionally high case fatality rate in another,” WHO said.\nEarlier in February, the country’s National Institute for Biomedical Research in Kinshasa tested samples from 12 active cases, and from one deceased person. Test results have ruled out similar hemorrhagic diseases such as Ebola andMarburgvirus.\nTesting and contact tracing are continuing in affected locations by teams of local staff and WHO officials. However, the remoteness of the two hotspots, as well as limited lab capacity and generally weak healthcare infrastructure in the DRC could see the disease spread further, the WHO warned.\nMeanwhile, isolation rooms have been set up in some villages in the region, and health workers are going to communities to brief people about the new disease.\nSome health experts have said they suspect the viral disease could be zoonotic – a disease which spreads from animals to humans – because of the reports of children eating a bat, which are known to carry viruses which can be deadly for humans. In the past, viruses such as Ebola and Marburg have struck human beings who have eaten infected bats.\nUntil the new disease can be identified, it is difficult to know how easily humans will be able to fight it off, Dr Zania Stamataki, an associate professor in viral immunology at the University of Birmingham, told the UK’s Science Media Centre.\n“If the infection originated from a virus that came from a bat, this tells us that it is unlikely that we have pre-existing immunity to this new infection for humans, so we are unprotected [and] we suffer severe disease and even death,” Stamataki said.\n“[But] if the virus is similar to other viruses infecting humans – like the COVID-causing virus was similar to some common cold coronaviruses – some people may stand a chance to show less severe symptoms and recover,” she added.\nThe country is currently in the grips of an armed conflict in the Eastern Kivu Province led by therebel M23 group, which recently captured the key towns of Goma (January 27) and Bukavu (February 14).\nViolence there has already devastated the region’s healthcare infrastructure and has caused massive displacement in recent months. Hospitals are overwhelmed and aid workers have also been attacked.\nPresently,an mpox outbreakis also ongoing in the region. DRC health officials and the WHO expressed concern about the high rate of fatalities –4.9 percent– last June, as well as about a new, more infectious variant discovered in Kamituga, South Kivu Province, in August.\nBetween November 25 and January 5, more than 2,400 cases of the disease and five deaths were reported. Since the start of the outbreak, DRC had reported a total of 11,834 cases and 1,304 deaths by February 23, according to the Africa Center for Disease Control.\nRecentshipmentsof mpox vaccines from Western donors such as the United States, Japan and the European Union enabled officials to provide vaccines to at least 50,000 people by December. It’s unclear how many vaccines are needed to cover the country’s 105 million population.\nThe virus has also spread to neighbouring Burundi, Uganda, Rwanda, and Kenya, although in lower numbers.\nIn December, the WHO reported that a newly identified, severe case of malaria hadcaused 48 deathswithin three months in Panzi, southern Kwango Province. That outbreak is ongoing.\nMeanwhile,Ugandahas newly recorded cases of the Sudan virus (in the same family as the Ebola virus). Nine cases and one death have been confirmed since January 30.\nTanzania is facing an outbreak of Marburg virus, in the northwest Kagera District. Since January, 10 cases have been reported including two confirmed and eight probable cases. All have resulted in death.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

        "headline": "Hama: A rebellious Syrian town that can finally mourn the Assad massacre",
        "body": "The city can finally mourn the tens of thousands of victims of Hafez al-Assad and the massacre he ordered 43 years ago.\nBassam Hlyhl\nHama, Syria– For more than 40 years, people in Hama spoke in whispers about the February 1982 massacre that then-President Hafez al-Assad unleashed on this city.\nSpeaking about it could lead a Syrian to join the hundreds of thousands of their compatriots in al-Assad’s prisons.\nNow, Syria’s fourth-largest city can commemorate and mourn in public the massacre of tens of thousands of people because Hafez’s son Bashar al-Assad was overthrown in December after an uprising and subsequent war that lasted 13 years.\nHama has been rebellious for generations, its historians say, with a sizeable chunk of its population having been expelled from other parts of Syria centuries ago and harbouring a distrust of central government diktats.\n“For 600 to 700 years, Hama has had a history of revolutions,” Suliman al-Suliei al-Hiraki, a historian from Hama, told Al Jazeera.\nDuring the Mamluk period (11th to 14th centuries) alone, al-Hiraki says, he counted more than 30 revolutions, some of which ended in bloodshed.\nThen, in 1964, one year after the Baath party – which Hafez al-Assad would later take over – took power in Syria, a landmark uprising took place there.\nUnrest and periodic violence continued until February 1982, when Hafez al-Assad ordered the full force of the Syrian army and regime-affiliated militias to crack down on a years-long Muslim Brotherhood-led uprising.\nThere was no quarter for the Hamawis, especially the Sunni Muslims who were targeted in the regime’s predominantly sectarian killings.\nAbdelrahman Bilal was 11 years old at the time – the memories haunt him to this day.\n“They martyred three of my relatives at the same time,” he said from the office of his car dealership in Hama. One of the three was only 14 years old.\nAnother one was arrested and later died in prison.\nEven among the litany of massacres committed by the Assad regimes – including the tens of thousands killed in the recent war – the Hama massacre stands out.\nBy the time they stopped, the army and militias, led by Hafez’s younger brother Rifaat, had killed thousands, the exact number unknown but estimated between 30,000 and 40,000 people, including entire families, according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights.\nLocals say young men, some merely teenagers, were rounded up, lined up and shot. They recall seeing piles and piles of bodies.\n“They took out entire neighbourhoods, all the men, and executed them at the door of their homes,” Bilal said.\nThe Assad regime also besieged the city while bombarding it, sometimes targeting the Muslim Brotherhood’s armed faction but often indiscriminately, and carrying out summary executions and torture.\n“For a period of about 10 to 15 years, I didn’t see any young people,” Bilal said. “People from the ages of 15 to 45 or 50, were all killed.”\nThe massacre seemed to shatter Hama’s rebellious nature. Instead, a new culture of silence took hold as Syrian forces, including the notorious intelligence, watched it closely.\n“[We told ourselves to] be careful and be quiet and don’t say anything,” Bilal said, adding that people were so scared that they did not even tell children what had happened for fear of repercussions.\nFor years, Bilal hid the portraits of his murdered relatives.\nA common refrain across Syria under al-Assad was: “The walls have ears.”\n“For the generation of ’82 … any talk about politics was forbidden,” al-Suliei al-Hiraki said, adding that Hama shuttered its prestigious publishing houses that were known across the Arab world.\n“[T]he arrests continued and the raids continued,” al-Suliei al-Hiraki said. “The city took on [a completely different] character.”\nIn the early days of the 2011 revolution, Hama was the scene of anti-regime protests that were so large they drew the attention of foreign diplomats.\nIt was also one of the places where the regime responded with quick, lethal force, killing more than 100 people.\nStill plagued by the traumas of the 1982 massacre, Hama seemed to largely go quiet after that.\nThen, on November 28, 2024, a shock rebel offensive liberated Aleppo to the north. A week later, they took Hama, then Homs and Damascus, forcing Bashar to flee and ending nearly five decades of the Assad dynastic rule.\nFinally rid of the Assads, Bilal brought out the portraits of his slain family for the first time and hung them on the wall in his office.\nThe young men in the photos have contemporary hairstyles and clothing, not the religious dress associated with the Muslim Brotherhood.\nFor decades, he said: “We didn’t look at their pictures.”\nNofal Nofal was also able to share images from 43 years ago.\nNofal, then 26, photographed the damage from regime bombardment on the city’s houses of worship during the 1982 massacre.\nWhile the majority of victims were Sunni, the bombardment campaign destroyed every church in Hama.\nNofal knew how great the risk was at the time he took the photos – so did Jihad Karbouj, who had gone out with him to photograph the scenes.\nThe 73-year-old Karbouj stood next to Nofal, now 69, in the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Hama’s salon where an exhibition of the photos was being held in commemoration.\nKarbouj laughs as he remembers how nervous he was then. “I told him, you better hurry up before they come and take us!”\nNofal kept the photos hidden, the passing decades doing nothing to reduce his fear that they might be discovered.\nAfter the regime fell, he published them on Facebook for the public to see for the first time, then the exhibition was arranged during this month of commemoration and mourning, an event that would never have happened under al-Assad.\nIn an echo of past worries, the police were stationed outside the church to make sure everything went smoothly. The church had been shot at by unidentified gunmen in the days after the fall of the regime, and nobody wanted to take any chances.\nInside, Nofal’s images showed the destruction of Hama’s churches and its Great Mosque, wrought by Assad regime bombs in 1982.\nOne set of before and after images shows a newly built – at the time – Greek Orthodox church side by side with a photo of the aftermath of a government attack that reduced it to rubble. The church had taken 20 years to complete and had never been prayed in.\nAbsent the fear that once gripped them, the dozens of people gathered in the salon – including Christian and Muslim religious figures – were free to remember and mourn.\n“Now, I’m living in freedom,” Nofal said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

        "body": "The British leader says foreign aid will suffer a 40 percent cut to bolster defence spending in light of a ‘new era’.\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced the country willincrease defence spendingby cutting its foreign aid budget, a move he says is necessary as the United Kingdom faces a “dangerous new era”.\nStarmer said on Tuesday that as the UK faces a “period of profound change” amid overseas conflicts, including a war in Ukraine, he has committed to increasing defence spending to 2.5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) by April 2027, up from the current 2.3 percent rate.\nHe also set out a target to spend “3 percent of GDP on defence” after the next general election in 2029.\n“It is my first duty as prime minister to keep our country safe. In an ever more dangerous world, increasing the resilience of our country so we can protect the British people, resist future shocks and bolster British interests is vital,” Starmer said, according to a government handout.\n“By spending more on defence, we will deliver the stability that underpins economic growth and will unlock prosperity through new jobs, skills and opportunity across the country,” he added.\nStarmer’s decision to announce the biggest increase in defence spending since the Cold War comes amid fears that a US decision to work closely with Russia to end the three-year war in Ukraine will sideline Kyiv and itsEuropean allies.\nThe decision also comes as Starmer travels to Washington, DC, to meet with US President Donald Trump on Thursday.\nHere’s what we know about the increase in defence spending:\nAccording to the Ministry of Defence, the UK spent 53.9 billion pounds ($68.3bn) on defence during the 2023-2024 financial year, which ended on March 31.\nStarmer announced on Tuesday that the hike in defence spending will total 13.4 billion pounds ($17bn) every year after cutting overseas aid from 0.5 percent to 0.3 percent until 2027.\nTrump has called on members of the NATO military alliance, which includes the UK, to commit to spending 5 percent of their GDPs on defence, a threshold that the US, which has the world’s largest military, does not meet.\nWhile NATO guidelines call on member states to spend at least 2 percent of national output on defence, in January, Secretary-General Mark Rutte also called for the spending goal to be increased to meet the “challenges of tomorrow”.\n\n\n\nAt a news conference on Tuesday, Starmer said increasing defence spending was “three years in the making”, referring to Russia’s war against Ukraine.\nWhen Sky News asked if the decision had been made after Trump called for European powers to increase spending, Starmer said it was “very much my decision”.\nHe said he had been “arguing for some time” that Europe and the UK “needed to do more”.\nStarmer added that while he was not “happy” to make the decision to cut foreign aid and would do “everything” to reinstate the funding, the “defence and security of the British people must always come first.”\nHowever, former Foreign Secretary and current International Rescue Committee President David Miliband condemned the foreign aid cut as a “blow to Britain’s proud reputation as a global humanitarian and development leader”.\n“Now is the time to step up and tackle poverty, conflict and insecurity, not further reduce the aid budget,” Miliband, who like Starmer is a member of the Labour Party, said in astatement.\nBenjamin Martill, senior lecturer in politics and international relations at the University of Edinburgh, told Al Jazeera that the decision to increase defence spending was “wholly unsurprising”.\n“The UK has been under pressure for years along with other European allies to increase the proportion of GDP it spends on defence and the proportion within that on R&D [research and development] and genuine investment, reflecting concerns that America is still largely bankrolling European defence,” Martill said.\nHowever, Ian Mitchell, co-director of Europe and senior policy fellow at the Centre for Global Development, told Al Jazeera that the decision was “short-sighted”.\n“I don’t think there’s any doubt that there’s a need to increase defence spending, but I think that cutting that from the aid budget is self-defeating. … [As] Russia invades Ukraine, the UK’s main response is to cut its international aid budget. I think that’s a terrible look for the UK reputationally and short-sighted,” he said.\n“There’s pressures on public spending, and he’s [Starmer’s] giving himself a major challenge by promising not to increase various taxes but also wanting to do more on public spending in relation to defence and health and elsewhere,” Mitchell explained.\nMartill explained that the investment in the UK’s defence capabilities would help modernise the armed forces at a time when Starmer has indicated that the future presence of British troops in Ukraine is a possibility as part of a security guarantee in a peace deal.\n“The increase in spending would contribute to the UK’s defence but also to the broader defence of Europe and would feed directly into the UK’s position in NATO and its contribution to other formats for defence cooperation,” Martill said.\nBut some critics have said a 2.5 percent allocation for defence two years from now isn’t enough to make Britain truly prepared militarily for the challenges it faces.\nFormer Defence Minister Ben Wallace of the Conservative Party called the decision a “staggering desertion of leadership”.\n“Tone deaf to dangers of the world and demands of the United States,” Wallace wrote on X, adding that it is a “weak” commitment to the nation’s security.\nextra 0.2% of GDP by 2027 on Defence?? A staggering desertion of leadership. Tone deaf to dangers of the world and demands of the United States. Such a weak commitment to our security and Nation puts us all at risk.\n— Rt. Hon Ben Wallace (@BenWallace70)February 25, 2025\n\nFormer British Military intelligence officer Philip Ingram also told The Times newspaper’s radio programme that Starmer should increase his pledge to “3 to 5 percent” of GDP for defence. The country needs to take a “war footing” because the path to World War III is becoming “clearer”, he said.\nIn the autumn budget, the government allocated 13.3 billion pounds ($16.9bn) in foreign aid for the 2024-2025 fiscal year and 13.7 billion pounds ($17.4bn) in 2025-26 – about 0.5 percent of national economic output.\nData from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office suggests that Africa is the biggest recipient of UK aid, followed by the Middle East and North African region and the Asia Pacific.\nStarmer announced a 40 percent cut to the foreign aid budget without elaborating on which areas will face the most cuts. Mitchell said the effects will be “very substantial”.\n“The UK has traditionally been quite a big humanitarian spender,” he said. “That seems impossible now in the light of the reductions.”\n“The UK’s aid budget is actually focused on some of the poorest countries in the world, … supporting basic health services, reproductive rights, life-saving interventions [that] are going to have to stop and people’s lives will unfortunately be lost,” he added.\nMoreover, Martill explained that foreign aid also serves as British “soft power” and is a “significant component in the UK’s relations with many Global South countries the UK has been seeking to actively co-opt into supporting its worldview”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

        "headline": "US, EU move apart as Trump eyes Ukraine’s minerals and a deal with Russia",
        "body": "Two United Nations votes find the US siding with Russia against Europe, as Ukraine’s Zelenskyy prepares to sign a US deal on mineral wealth.\nZelenskyy to sign US mineral deal amid security uncertainty\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he plans to meet US President Donald Trump “as early as this Friday” to sign a bilateral commercial agreement to jointly develop and manage Ukraine’s mineral wealth.\nTrump insisted on the deal three weeks after assuming office in return for the assistance the US has provided in the three years since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, telling an interviewer, “I told [Ukraine] that I want the equivalent of, like, $500bn worth of rare earth, and they’ve essentially agreed to do that.”\nZelenskyy publicly rejected that figure, and hetwice rejectedany deal that did not contain security guarantees for Ukraine.\nA text of the agreement published by Western media on Wednesday did not reveal any guarantees, and placed no upper limit on the value the United States would receive – though Trump told reporters “it could be a trillion-dollar deal.”\nThe leaked agreement says Ukraine and the US would establish a joint fund, and Ukraine would “contribute to the Fund 50 percent of all revenues earned from the future monetisation of all relevant Ukrainian Government-owned natural resource assets … defined as deposits of minerals, hydrocarbons, oil, natural gas, and other extractable materials.”\nIt also included the revenues generated by infrastructure such as fossil gas terminals and ports.\nThe revenues of this fund would be reinvested “to promote the safety, security and prosperity of Ukraine”, it said.\nAjoint report this weekfrom the European Commission, World Bank, United Nations and Ukrainian government put the country’s reconstruction cost at well over half a trillion dollars.\nThe minerals agreement also did not address where that left European Union members, who have provided more than half the military and financial aid Ukraine has received, other than to say Ukraine and the US “will strive to avoid conflicts with Ukraine’s obligations under its accession to the European Union”.\nFrench Defence Minister Sebastien Lecornu revealed that he has been in talks with Ukraine since October to secure access to rare minerals vital to the defence and electronics industries.\n“Our defence industry will need a number of very key raw materials in our own weapons systems, not for next year, but for the next 30 or 40 years. We have to diversify that,” he said in a televised interview.\nOn the day the agreement was leaked, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk wrote on social media, “Uncertainty, unpredictability, deals. Are these really the rules that the new international order should be based on?”\nTrump has made no secret of his adversarial view of the EU. “The European Union was formed to screw the United States. That’s the purpose of it and they’ve done a very good job,” he told reporters at the start of his first cabinet meeting on February 26.\nTusk reacted by posting, “The EU wasn’t formed to screw anyone. Quite the opposite. It was formed to maintain peace, to build respect among our nations, to create free and fair trade.”\nTrump’s departure from a common position with Europe on Ukraine had become apparent when he started direct talks with Russia on February 18 that didn’t include Ukraine or the EU. A second round of those talks was to take place in Istanbul on Thursday.\nAs the war hit its third anniversary on Monday, Trump moved further away, siding with Russia in a UN Security Council vote that avoided naming Russia the aggressor in the war, or demanding the return of Ukrainian lands Russia has seized.\nEU members on the Security Council – including Britain, France, Greece, Slovenia and Denmark – abstained.\nThe US attempted to pass the same text in aUN General Assembly (UNGA) voteearlier in the day, but was rejected. The resolution the UNGA did pass also avoided naming Russia the aggressor in the war, but called for the restoration of Ukraine’s territorial integrity, in accordance with the UN Charter.\nIn 2023, Ukraine hadembarked on an effortto pass a UNGA resolution condemning Russia as an aggressor. Monday’s resolution, passed by 93 out of 193 countries, showed how far Ukraine is from garnering the two-thirds majority it seeks.\n“The system once based on rules, agreements, and shared values has been under a tsunami of geopolitical and geo-economic challenges … Now, its whole existence is under question,” wrote Victoria Vdovychenko, a programme leader at the University of Cambridge’s Centre for Geopolitics, in an article marking the war anniversary.\nIn a sign of Trump’s power, Europeans have tried to appease him despite the growing distance between them.\nThe day after the UN votes, French PresidentEmmanuel Macronheld a jovial press conference with Trump in the White House, where he offered cautious support for the minerals deal.\nHe also agreed that European countries “need to do more … to more fairly share the security burden that your country has been carrying for so many years”.\nPete Hegseth, Trump’s defence secretary, flatly stated on February 12 that “stark strategic realities prevent the United States of America from being primarily focused on the security of Europe,” and called on Europeans to spend 5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) on defence.\nBritish Prime MininsterKeirStarmer becamethe second EU leader to oblige Trump by announcing a hike in defence spending ahead of a trip to Washington on Thursday. Defence spending in the UK would go from 2 to 2.5 percent of GDP by 2027, and 3 percent by 2029, he said.\nHegseth told Europeans they would have to provide the “overwhelming share” of aid to Ukraine.\nThat was underlined this week, as Trump said he would not undertake the lion’s share of security guarantees.\nTrump told reportershe wasn’t going to oblige.\n“I’m not going to make security guarantees beyond very much,” he said on Wednesday. “We’re going to have Europe do that.”\nThat appeared to dampen the hopes Zelenskyy expressed after Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine, General Keith Kellogg, visited him in Kyiv on February 20. Zelenskyy said they had had a “good conversation” with “a lot of details” on security guarantees, among other things.\nOn SundayZelenskyy even offeredTrump his resignation after Trump called him a dictator.\n“If it’s about peace in Ukraine and you really want me to leave my position, I am ready to do that,” he told reporters. “Secondly, I can exchange it for NATO [membership] if there is such an opportunity.”\nEarlier in the day, Russia had unleashed its largest air attack of the war against Ukrainian cities, involving 267 Shahed kamikaze drones and three ballistic missiles. Ukraine shot down or used electronic jamming to disorient all but seven of the drones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

        "body": "Inside the displacement crisis in Catatumbo, Colombia\nCucuta, Colombia –On the eleventh of February, a baby girl was born by Caesarean section in the riverside town of Tibu, Colombia. Five days later, her family’s home lay empty.\nForced to flee Tibu under the cover of night, they had joined the more than 55,000 people who have beendisplacedby a fresh eruption of violence.\nFor more than six decades, Colombia has contended with a deadly internal conflict between government forces, left-wing rebels, criminal networks and right-wing paramilitaries.\nA breakthrough, however, arrived in 2016: The Colombian government signed an agreement with the largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), for its fighters to lay down their arms.\nBut theviolence in Catatumbo, the region where Tibu is located, is the latest indication of how elusive peace can be.\nSince January 18,FARC dissidentswho refused the 2016 peace deal have clashed with members of theNational Liberation Army (ELN), another rebel group.\nConfronted with kidnappings, shootings and explosions, tens of thousands of people in Catatumbo have since abandoned their homes. The United Nations has called it thelargest mass displacementcaused by a single event in Colombia since its records began.\nThe baby girl and her five-year-old brother are among those displaced. She cries as her stroller rattles over the paving stones that surround a medical care tent in the city of Cucuta, 120 kilometres (75 miles) south of where she was born.\nHer 26-year-old mother, who asked to remain anonymous for safety reasons, was only days into her postpartum period when she had to pack her children and leave. In Tibu, she feared ELN fighters would come for her family.\n“They were threatening us,” said the mother, her dark hair falling over the shoulders of her pink dress as she sat in one of the plastic chairs outside the medical tent. “We were so afraid that we had to leave.”\nShe explained the ELN had released a series of photos depicting supposed FARC collaborators — and her husband was among them. Fearing ELN fighters were watching the roads, she was forced to leave him behind in order to escape.\n“I’m worried for my husband because he’s still there,” she said, a silver-coloured wedding ring flashing on the hand she used to rock the baby’s stroller. “I hope he will be able to leave so he can join us here.”\n‘So many people taken’\n\nSituated on the border with Venezuela, Cucuta is now a temporary home to 27,000 of the people displaced in the current spate of violence.\nIn response to the conflict, the General Santander Stadium has been designated as a humanitarian aid centre, providing food, clothing and basic medical care to the displaced.\nBeneath the concrete arches on the outside of the stadium, lines of people await assistance, some leaning against the metal bars that form barriers along the perimeter. The mood is tense.\n“Right now they are still fighting, removing people, going house to house,” a 21-year-old man from Tibu told Al Jazeera, his youthful face peering out from a curtain of dark hair.\nThe braces on his teeth flashed in the midday sun. “They’ve already killed many of our friends.”\nThe local government and nonprofits in Cucuta are already feeling the strain of the growing crisis.\n“We haven’t seen this kind of displacement before,” said Fernando Sandoval Sanchez, the director of the Colombian Civil Defense, a disaster-relief agency, for the department of Norte de Santander. “So many people taken from their homes, from their land, from their belongings.”\nThe mayor’s office says around 280 displaced people are currently staying in a shelter a short distance from Cucuta in Villa del Rosario, while 1,330 more are housed in local hotels — a costly short-term solution financed by the local government.\nBut many more are left to find housing on their own, with little support outside their own finances. Some stay with family. Others have considered returning to Catatumbo.\nA few hotels have responded to the increased demand by raising their prices, making a profit from the crisis.\n“The budget is already running out,” says Lusestella Maldonado, a volunteer for the mayor’s office who is part of the team coordinating the humanitarian response at the stadium.\n“Obviously we don’t have many resources, and every day we see more and more displacement. The problem is growing.”\nThe exodus from the largely rural Catatumbo has also devastated the region’s economy.\nCatatumbo’s farmers have been forced to leave their crops and livestock, creating food shortages. That has led locals to also seek support, increasing the burden on nonprofits and government services.\nThe mounting pressure on humanitarian aid has created uncertainty for the displaced population from Catatumbo.\n“I don’t know until when we will receive help here,” said the 26-year-old mother. “We are just waiting.”\nA government setback\n\nAs Colombia heads deeper into its most significant period of internal conflict in recent times, the turmoil has also exposed cracks in PresidentGustavo Petro’s ambitious “total peace” policy.\nPetro, a former guerrilla fighter himself, was elected in 2022 on the premise that he would seek an end to Colombia’s armed conflict through formal negotiations with rebel groups.\nButpeace talkswith the ELN have been fitful, with outbursts of violence forcing the dialogues to start and stop repeatedly.\nIn 2024, for instance, talks wereseveredafter the ELN was blamed for an attack that left two soldiers killed. And in January, Petro once againsuspendedpeace negotiations with the ELN as a result of theviolence in Catatumbo.\nHe also declared astate of emergencyin the region, a move that allowed him to impose curfews and other restrictions.\nSome, however, have accused the state of failing to fill thepower vacuumleft in rural Colombia after the FARC was dismantled in 2016.\n“This conflict will only stop on the day when the apparatus of the state really arrives in the territory,” said Albeiro Bohorquez, an adviser to the mayor’s office in Cucuta.\nHe pointed to the slow progress in establishing rural infrastructure and social programmes as one of the reasons for the conflict in Catatumbo.\n“Four years ago, the process to create the University of Catatumbo started. Construction has still not begun,” Bohórquez said. “Four years ago, they were speaking about the Catatumbo railway. It has also not been able to move forwards.”\nThe lack of infrastructure and opportunity has created an environment in which thecoca trade, a key driver of Colombia’s internal conflict, has flourished.\nCoca is the raw ingredient in cocaine, and Colombia is the world’s largest source for the drug.\n“Unless the dominance of coca over the territory's financial and administrative dynamic changes, nothing will be able to compete with it,\" said Bohorquez.\nIn an effort to muster the necessary resources to deal with the ongoing crisis, Petro’s government has raised additional taxes on coal and oil.\nBut for many of the displaced residents in Cucuta, the state has yet to answer a simple question: When will we be able to go home?\nThe young man from Tibu, who lost friends to the ongoing violence, said he places the matter in God’s hands.\n“Everyone wants to go back home,” he said as he waited for aid outside Cucuta’s stadium. “You have to have faith.”\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

        "headline": "‘No one talks about this’: Remembering Germany’s role in colonising Africa",
        "body": "How do Germans remember – or forget – their colonial history and role in the Berlin Conference that carved up Africa 140 years ago?\nBerlin, Germany –The plaque that marks 77 William Street, the building in the German capital where ameetingthat forever shaped Africa’s fate took place, is different.\nUnlike those beside it – official square plaques that tell of Germany’s Nazi history in sombre colours – this one is set awkwardly in front of a tree and bears an old map of Africa in vibrant hues of red and blue. That’s because it’s fairly new – put up just three years ago by the nonprofit Afrika Forum instead of the city of Berlin.\nIn a country long hailed for its detailed and prolific remembrance of Nazi crimes during the 20th century, the Africa plaque’s obscure loneliness highlights how Germany remembers – or forgets – its colonial past.\nOn a winter afternoon, a few tourists troop past without as much as a glance, heading towards the remnants of the Berlin Wall, about 200 metres (650 feet) away, and a memorial for Jews murdered in the Holocaust. No longer a palace, the old 77 building now houses an apartment block and a couple of restaurants and cafes on the bottom level. Even the people working nearby do not know how important this location is in African history – “Keine Ahnung [No idea],” one waitress, replied, when asked.\nExactly 140 years ago today, European leaders gathered at this spot finalised the carving up of Africa and the rules of the colonisation game. They’d been haggling on and off for about three months, from November 15, 1884, until February 26, 1885, arguing about who owned which territories on the continent. Known as the Berlin or the Congo Conference, the meeting would go on to accelerate the occupation of African nations, affecting the fate of that continent in ways that stillreverberate today.\nHere in Germany though, that history is largely a black hole.\n\n\n\n“I don’t remember that we talked about colonialism a lot,” Berlin resident Sanga Lenz, 34, told Al Jazeera. Growing up, her school’s history curriculum centred around the Holocaust, the second world war, and the Cold War. A history teacher once took the class to a slavery exhibition and introduced Lenz to German imperialism. But it wasn’t until 2020 when she stumbled on a photo of an old male relative who was deployed to the colonies that she realised just how deeply connected she was to that past.\n“He was stationed in German East Africa and he was building these train tracks there. I was like, wait a minute. Of course, this happened, but nobody ever talked about it. Growing up in Germany people talk about how some relatives were Nazis, but no one talks about this history,” Lenz said incredulously.\nJohnny Whitlam, a tour guide in the city, said he is one of few who tries to bring his clients through William Street to point out the Africa plaque. “People are usually happy to find out about this, even if that’s not what they came to see,” he said.\nStill, he admits, interest in the monument is minimal, something he believes largely reflects that authorities have not prioritised the issue.\n“I’d say there’s definitely not enough being done in terms of the awareness of this history,” Whitlam said.\nFor Nadja Ofuatey-Alazard, an activist and co-director of Each One Teach One (EOTO) which advocates for the interests of Africans and Afro-Germans, Germany has chosen to focus on its most recent dark history but has failed to examine its brutal precursor.\n“Germany is slow to come to the realisation that it was a colonial power,” Ofuatey-Alazard said. “Its main historical focus is on National Socialist history but there was a predecessor to that, and so Germany has to this day, not yet acted upon its historic responsibility. It needs to come into the mainstream. It has to wind up in schools and universities.”\nIn the late 1800s, European powers became embroiled in a mad “scramble for Africa”, as that period is now known. Their aim was to take control of resources they’d been buying on the continent – from rubber to palm oil.\nGermany, the United Kingdom, Portugal and France each tried to outdo the other, forcing local African leaders to sign exclusive “protection treaties” that meant they’d lose their sovereignty. At times, colonial officers bought vast expanses of African territory, or in other instances, scouts simply staked a country’s flag in an African nation to claim it.\nAt the time, 77 William Street was the palace of the then-German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, the leader who took on the task of summoning his rival European counterparts to the Berlin Conference to avoid a war in Europe as countries began butting heads over the colonies.\nInitially, historians note, Bismarck was only vaguely interested in the race for Africa due to the cost of building and supporting colonial governments, as well as the complicated diplomatic overtures required. However, he was pressured by a growing movement of German pro-colonial writers and lobbyists who took to the media to highlight the opportunities to expand the German Empire’s sphere of influence. Germany was rapidly industrialising, and free labour and resources from the colonies was an opportunity Bismarck later came to appreciate. But there had to be some order, Bismarck and officials of the French government agreed, according to documents detailing their correspondence in the months before the meeting was called.\nFourteen countries took part in the Berlin Conference, with 19 delegates in total, including from the United States. There were no African representatives, not even from the Europe-recognised nations of Ethiopia, Liberia or Zanzibar.\nBy the end of the conference, a General Act spelling out the rules of “effective occupation” had emerged: Countries were to no longer merely stake flags and declare territories as their own, for example, but had to actually enforce their authority on the existing African nations. There was also to be free navigation in the Congo and Niger Basins, and Belgium’s King Leopold’s claim on the area that would later be called the Congo Free State was recognised.\nGermany claimed four major areas: German East Africa, Kamerun, Togoland, and German Southwest Africa.\nSome researchers do not fully agree that the Berlin Conference singularly sealed Africa’s fate, as is widely believed. Jack Paine, a researcher with Emory University, told Al Jazeera that African states were already forming before the conference and that the boundaries of many countries would not be official until many years after. However, the conference likely went on to prompt a more frenzied rush to occupy colonies, he added.\n“The Berlin Conference was a clear symbol of European greed and hubris,” Paine said. “In many ways, it served to legitimise [among Europeans] the ongoing process of claiming African territory, although even this interpretation warrants caution. Perhaps having a large number of leading statesmen convene together in person did more to boost efforts to dominate the entire area relative to an alternative world in which the conference did not convene.”\nIndeed, within five years of the conference, the percentage of colonised parts of Africa went from 20 to 90 percent. The German Schutztruppe, or colonial guard, was particularly brutal in the colonies. Inpresent-day Namibia, German troops massacred thousands from the revolting Herero and Nama people for their resistance, and then put them in concentration camps.\n“They rented out the women to German companies and German settlers,” activist Sima Luipert, whose great-grandmother was “rented” and who is now part of a group of Herero and Nama leaders pressing Germany for reparations,toldAl Jazeera.\nBecause Germany lost World War I, and thus all its African possessions by 1919, there’s a lingering sense in the country that it didn’t have much stake in the game, and that other European powers, such as Belgium, did much worse. But that thinking is flawed, activists point out.\n“European leaders love to point to each other and say, ‘No, they did worse than us,’” Ofuatey-Alazard of EOTO said. “The truth is that they all did terrible things. Germany needs to acknowledge that history more.”\nHoping to push for better acknowledgement of that history, Ofuatey-Alazard has led the organisation of a series of “Decolonisation” Conferences since 2020, a project partly sponsored by the state. At the first conference, she invited delegates from African countries who gathered to discuss the impacts of colonisation on Africa today.\n“I decided to come up with a format that was a counter-conference,” she said. “Since there had been 19 delegates at the historic [Berlin] Conference representing 14 nations back then, I mirrored that and invited 19 women of African descent, because obviously, historically it had been 19 men.”\nIn the most recent conference in November, another set of 19 delegates, this time all people of African descent, came up with a 10-point list of demands for European countries: Pay reparations, abolish tenuous visa regimes, and protect human rights at a time when Europe is veering dangerously to the right, the document read. However, the European Union has not yet responded to those requests, the activist said.\nGrowing up in Germany, Justice Lufuma Mvemba said she struggled to reconcile what she was being taught in school and her conversations with peers, with her family’s reality.\nHer family fled from the Democratic Republic of the Congo amid a period of political unrest in the 1990s. The country was badly fractured due to intervention in its local politics by colonial powers, and is still at war today.  At home, her father’s fear of violence was so enormous that he wouldn’t let them play with toy guns.\nBut in Germany, people would refer to colonial history as being “not that relevant”, and history classes were devoid of any critical thinking on imperialism. “I was confused,” said Mvemba, 33, who found it hard not to notice how Africa’s resources were being dominated by foreign powers.\nNow, looking to offer a more realistic view of the situation, Mvemba founded the Decolonial City Tour, specifically showing residents and tourists alike the parts of Berlin that still carry colonial and controversial histories. It’s a unique concept in the city.\nA typical tour takes visitors down to the African Quarters, in the city’s Mitte district. The quiet residential area, filled with pastel-coloured modernist apartment blocks, was initially developed by animal lover Carl Hagenbeck to house a human zoo where “exotic” people from German colonies would be exhibited. It is why some of the streets here are named after former colonies: Togo Street, or Windhoek Street for example. Hagenbeck’s death from a snakebite and the outbreak of World War I, however, scuttled those plans.\nAt Manga-Bell Square, tourists learn that the public space only got its name in 2022. Initially, it was named after Gustav Nachtigal, the German commissioner for Africa who was instrumental in taking control of Cameroon, Togo and Namibia. After years of controversy, the Berlin city council finally renamed it after Rudolf Manga-Bell, the Cameroonian prince who was executed by colonial Germany in 1914 on charges of treason because he dared to question the arbitrary displacement of his people, the Duala.\nAs the group walks around, guides often throw in fun facts. One that leaves many stunned is that the popular German grocery store, Edeka, was originally an acronym for (E)inkaufsgenossenschaft (de)r (K)olonialwarenhaendler or the Cooperative of Colonial Grocers.\nMvemba said she often gets positive reactions from her mostly German clientele. “It’s always interesting to see people’s reactions to that,” she said. “People are always like, ‘Wow, I had no idea’, and they do appreciate that history.”\nOn the other hand, some struggle to see the less pleasant side of Germany, pushing back on the tours by questioning Mvemba, or very quietly slipping away as the group rounds a corner, she said. “It’s a very small percentage, but it’s there. And sometimes we get nasty comments on social media, too.”\nThis is part of why activists say Germany needs to invest more in memorialising its history, alongside paying appropriate reparations to its former colonies. While Ofuatey-Alazard credits the outgoing government of Olaf Scholz under the Social Democratic Party for putting its African past on the agenda, she also says the future of remembrance in the country is shaky.\nIn last week’s general elections, the conservative Christian Democrats Union (CDU) party won, but the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) partyrecorded strong gains too, becoming the strongest opposition in parliament. That’s a threat, the activist said.\n“Even though [the far-right] might not wind up in government as the conservatives have promised, the problem is that they are sort of driving the others, and pushing the others, and so that is of concern,” Ofuatey-Alazard said. “And definitely, the AfD is completely against any decolonial or memory culture. They consider addressing the past shameful and so they are completely in denial. So we don’t know how that will affect our work. We are obviously very worried.”\nUpdate, February 27, 2025:In a statement to Al Jazeera after publication, a spokesperson for the German government said the administration has prioritised an appraisal of colonial injustices, citing the2018 returnof human remains of people killed during the Herero and Nama revolt in Namibia in the early 20th century, as well as the return of art work stolen during that era, such as the Nigerian Benin Bronzes in2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

        "body": "UN High Commmissioner for Refugees says it “deeply regrets” move and denounces Bangkok’s violation of international law.\nThailand has deported at least 40Uighursto China’s Xinjiang region despite strong objections from activists and human rights groups, who warned that the deportees were at risk of torture, ill-treatment and “irreparable harm” if returned.\nThailand’s Defence Minister Phumtham Wechayachai confirmed the deportation on Thursday, telling the Reuters news agency that China gave assurance that the Uighurs sent back to Xinjiang would be looked after.\nIn the early hours of Thursday, several trucks with windows covered in black tape were seen leaving the Bangkok immigration centre where the 48 Uighurs had been held, images in domestic media reports showed.\nA few hours later, an unscheduled China Southern Airlines flight left the Don Mueang airport in Bangkok to land six hours later inKashgarin China’s Xinjiang region, according to the flight tracker Flightradar24.\nFor years, rights groups have been accusing China of widespread abuses, includingmass detention of Uighurs, a mainly Muslim ethnic minority that numbers about 10 million in the western region of Xinjiang. Beijing rejects those claims.\nLast month, UN rights experts had pleaded with the Thai government not to deport 48 Uighurs, warning that they were at risk of persecution. The 48 were part of a group of 300 who fled China and were arrested in 2014. Some were sent back to China and others to Turkiye, with the rest kept in Thailand. At leasttwo died in custody.\nOn Thursday, China’s Ministry of Public Security said 40 Chinese “illegal migrants” had been deported from Thailand “in accordance with… international law”.\nAsked specifically whether the group included Uighur detainees, Beijing’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said only that they had “Chinese nationality”.\n\n\n\n“The repatriations… were a concrete measure of cooperation between (China and Thailand) in combating cross-border crimes,” ministry spokesman Lin Jian told a regular news briefing.\nChina’s state news agency, Xinhua, also confirmed the deportation, saying 40 Chinese had been “bewitched by criminal organisations” and were stranded in Thailand. The report said their families had repeatedly asked the Chinese government to assist in their return.\nThailand’s Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatrarefused to confirm the news earlier on Thursday.\n“This sort of issue, for any country, one has to follow the law, international process and human rights,” she told reporters, without elaborating.\nThe UN High Commissioner for Refugees later denounced the move, saying it “deeply regrets the deportation” carried out by Thailand’s government.\n“This is a clear violation of the principle of non-refoulement and the Royal Thai Government’s obligations under international law,” UNHCR’s assistant high commissioner for protection, Ruvendrini Menikdiwela, said in a statement.\nThe Cross Cultural Foundation, a Thai human rights group, said it would petition a court on Thursday for an immediate inquiry to compel officials to testify on the status of the Uighurs and present the detainees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

        "headline": "How Project 2025, which Trump disavowed, is shaping his health policies",
        "body": "During his campaigning Trump denied he had read the right-wing wish list. Has he shifted his strategy?\nFew voters likely expected President Donald Trump in the first weeks of his administration to slash billions of dollars from the nation’s premier federal cancer research agency.\nBut funding cuts to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) were presaged inProject 2025’s “Mandate for Leadership”, a conservative plan for governance that Trump said he knew nothing about during his campaign. Now, his administration has embraced it.\n\n\n\n\nThe922-page playbookcompiled by The Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group in Washington, says “the NIH monopoly on directing research should be broken” and calls for capping payments to universities and their hospitals to “help reduce federal taxpayer subsidisation of leftist agendas”.\nUniversities, now slated to face sweeping cuts in agency grants that cover these overhead costs, say the policy will destroy ongoing and future biomedical science. A federal judge temporarily halted the cuts to medical researchon February 10after they drew legal challenges from medical institutions and 22 states.\nThe rapid-fire adoption of many of Project 2025’s objectives indicates that Trump supporters – many of its contributors were veterans of his first term, and some have joined his second administration – have for years quietly laid the groundwork to disrupt the national health system. That runs counter to Trump’s insistence on the campaign trail, after Democrats made Project 2025 a potent attack line, that he was ignorant of the document.\n\n\n\n“I have no idea what Project 2025 is,” Trump said on October 31, 2024, at a rally in Albuquerque, New Mexico – one of many times he disclaimed any knowledge of the plan. “I’ve never read it, and I never will.”\nBut because his administration is hewing to The Heritage Foundation-compiled playbook so closely, opposition groups and some state Democratic leaders say they are able to act swiftly to counter Trump’s moves in court.\nThey are now preparing for Trump to act on Project 2025 recommendations for some of the nation’s largest and most important health programmes, including Medicaid and Medicare, and forfederal health agencies.\n“There has been a lot of planning on the litigation side to challenge the executive orders and other early actions from a lot of different organisations,” said Noah Bookbinder, president of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a watchdog group. “Project 2025 allowed for some preparation.”\nThe plan, for example, calls for state flexibility to impose premiums for some beneficiaries, work requirements, and lifetime caps or time limits on Medicaid coverage for some enrollees in the programme for low-income and disabled Americans, which could lead to a surge in the number of uninsured after the Biden administration vastly expanded the programme’s coverage.\n“These proposals don’t directly alter eligibility for Medicaid or the benefits provided, but the ultimate effect would be fewer people with health coverage,” said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. “When you erect barriers to people enrolling in Medicaid, like premiums or documenting work status, you end up rationing coverage by complexity and ability to pay.”\nCongressional Republicans are contemplating a budget plan that could result in hundreds of billions of dollars being trimmed from Medicaid over 10 years.\nProject 2025 called for expanding access to health plans that don’t comply with theAffordable Care Act’sstrongest consumer protections. That may lead to more choice and lower monthly premiums for buyers, but unwitting consumers may face potentially huge out-of-pocket costs for care the plans won’t cover.\nThe Project 2025 also called for halting Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood affiliates. The organisation, an important healthcare provider for women across the country, gets roughly $700m annually from Medicaid and other government programmes, based on its 2022-23 report. Abortion made up about 4 percent of services the organisation provided to patients, the report says.\nThe administration’s steps to scrub words such as “equity” from federal documents, erase transgender identifiers, andcurtail international medical aid– all part of the Project 2025 wish list – have already had sweeping ramifications, hobbling access to healthcare and eviscerating international programmes that aim to prevent disease and improve maternal health outcomes.\nUnder amemorandum issued in January, for example, Trump reinstated and expanded a ban on federal funds to global organisations that provide legal information on abortions.\nStudies have found that the ban, known as the “global gag rule” or “Mexico City Policy”, has stripped millions of dollars fromforeign aidgroups that didn’t abide by it. It’s also had a chilling effect: In Zambia, one group removed information in brochures on contraception, and in Turkiye, some providers stopped talking with patients about menstrual regulation as a form of family planning.\n\n\n\nProject 2025 called on the next president to reinstate the gag rule, saying it “should be drafted broadly to apply to all foreign assistance”.\nTrump also signed an executive order rolling back transgender rights bybanning federal fundsfor transition-related care for people under age 19.An order he signedalso directed the federal government to recognise only two sexes, male and female, and use the term “sex” instead of “gender”.\nThe Project 2025 document calls for deleting the term “gender identity” from federal rules, regulations, and grants and for unwinding policies and procedures that its authors say are used to advance a “radical redefinition of sex”. In addition, it states that Department of Health and Human Services programmes should “protect children’s minds and bodies”.\n“Radical actors inside and outside government are promoting harmful identity politics that replaces biological sex with subjective notions of ‘gender identity’,” the Project 2025 road map reads.\nData disappears\nAs a result of Trump’s order on gender identity, health researchers say, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)took down online informationabout transgender health and removed data on LGBTQ+ health. A federal judge on February 11 ordered that much of the information be restored; the administration complied but added notices to some webpages labelling them “extremely inaccurate” and claiming they don’t “reflect biological reality”.\nThe CDC also delayed the release of information and findings on bird flu in the agency’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. In addition, federal workers have said they were told to retract papers that contain words such as “nonbinary” or “transgender”. And some hospitals suspended gender-affirming care such as hormone therapy and puberty blockers for youths.\nAdvocacy groups say the orders discriminate and pose barriers to medically necessary care, and transgender children and their families have filed a number of court challenges.\nLawyers, advocates, and researchers say implementation of many of Project 2025’s health policy goals poses a threat.\n“The playbook presents an anti-science, anti-data, and anti-medicine agenda,” according to a piece last year by Boston University researchers in the JAMA journal.\nThe Project 2025 blueprint sets out goals to curb access to medication abortion, restructure public health agencies, and weaken protections against sex-based discrimination. It would have seniors enrol by default in Medicare Advantage plans run by commercial insurers, in essence privatising the health programme for older Americans. And it calls for eliminating coverage requirements for Affordable Care Act plans that people buy without federal subsidies, which, insurance experts say, risks leaving people underinsured.\n“It’s the agenda of the Trump administration,” said Robert Weissman, a co-president of Public Citizen, a progressive consumer rights advocacy group. “It’s to minimise access to care under the guise of strict work requirements in Medicaid, privatising Medicare, and rolling back consumer protections and subsidies in the Affordable Care Act.”\nThe White House didn’t respond to a message seeking comment. Conservatives have said implementation of the project’s proposals would curb waste and fraud in federal health programmes and free health systems from the clutches of a radical “woke” agenda.\n“Americans are tired of their government being used against them,” Paul Dans, a lawyer and former director of Project 2025, said in a 2024 statement. “The administrative state is, at best, completely out of touch with the American people and, at worst, is weaponised against them.”\nDans did not return messages seeking comment for this article.\nThe Heritage Foundation has sought to separate itself and Project 2025 from Trump’s executive orders and other initiatives on health.\n“This isn’t about our recommendations in Project 2025 – something we’ve been doing for more than 40 years. This is about President Trump delivering on his promises to make America safer, stronger, and better than ever before, and he and his team deserve the credit,” Ellen Keenan, a spokesperson for Heritage, said in a statement.\n\n\n\nVersions of the document have been produced roughly every four years since the 1980s and have influenced other GOP presidents. Former President Ronald Reagan adopted about two-thirds of the recommendations from an earlier Heritage guide, the group says.\nIn some instances, the Trump administration hasn’t just followed Project 2025’s proposals but gone beyond them.\nThe document called on the next president to scale back and “deradicalise” the US Agency for International Development (USAID), an independent federal agency that provides foreign aid and assistance, including for many international health programmes.\nThe administration hasn’t justscaled back USAID. Trump adviser Elon Musk bragged on his social media platform, X, that his “Department of Government Efficiency” fed the agency “into the woodchipper”, physically closing its offices and putting nearly all its staff on administrative leave while ending funding for its programmes and disseminating misinformation about them.\nBut the administration risks waning public support if it adopts the project’s goals to upend US healthcare and health policy. Almost 60 percent of voters said they felt negatively about Project 2025 in a September poll by NBC News.\n“Project 2025 was never a thought exercise; it was always a blueprint,” said Ally Boguhn, a spokesperson for Reproductive Freedom for All, an abortion rights group. “We’re only a few weeks into his presidency, and it’s setting the groundwork for even more.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

        "headline": "The US Constitution was not made to protect against Trump",
        "body": "The belief that the US Constitution can protect against despotism has always been an illusion.\nThe fear gripping large swaths of the American public under the second administration of Donald Trump is unprecedented in modern US history. The president’s brazen acts of retribution against political opponents, open hostility towards dissent, and disregard for democratic norms make it clear that he intends to wield power with even fewer restraints than before.\nIt is tempting to reduce the United States’ political crisis to the simple notion that poor choices at the ballot box yield poor outcomes.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the terrifying reality is that constitutional and legal safeguards, long assumed to be bulwarks against authoritarian rule, have proven alarmingly ineffective. That is because elite privilege and authoritarianism are part of the DNA of the US Constitution.\nDespite the lofty rhetoric of liberty espoused by the founding founders, the constitution they drafted was not about freedom and equality for all.\nAs originally conceived, it was a deeply flawed, pro-slavery document drafted by an elite class of white male property owners whose primary concern was preserving their economic and political dominance. The so-called principles of liberty and democracy were designed to exclude most of the population, including enslaved people, women, and the poor.\nFar from being a charter of universal rights, the US Constitution enshrined systemic inequality, ensuring power remained concentrated in the hands of a privileged few.\nIt is not a coincidence that the US lags behind much of the world in securing fundamental rights. Unlike many democracies, where constitutions explicitly recognise economic and social rights as fundamental to human dignity, the US Constitution contains no such guarantees. There is no constitutional right to healthcare, housing, a living wage, or basic economic security. This absence is not accidental; it reflects the priorities of a system designed to serve economic elites.\nIn the US, these protections remain elusive, dismissed as “radical” by an establishment bent on privileging wealth and power over human wellbeing. It is not surprising that the American government spares no expense for military power but refuses to extend the same urgency to its citizens’ socioeconomic security.\nWhile extending few economic and social rights to American citizens, the US Constitution grants US presidents wide-ranging power to do as they please.\nUnlike leaders in most democracies, the US president wields extraordinary unilateral powers with little judicial or legislative oversight. The president can halt or pursue federal prosecutions, selectively enforce laws, control immigration policies, classify or declassify government secrets, override agency rulemaking, and purge “disloyal” officials—all without meaningful checks.\nForeign policy decisions, including treaty withdrawals and military interventions, require parliamentary approval elsewhere, yet American presidents can unilaterally exit treaties and deploy troops exploiting loopholes in the War Powers Resolution without congressional authorisation.\nEmergency powers, which in most democracies require legislative oversight, are virtually unchecked in the US, allowing the executive to seize assets, impose sanctions, and redirect funds on the mere declaration of a national emergency.\nIn stark contrast to democracies where courts actively check executive overreach, the American judiciary consistently defers to the executive in foreign affairs even where there are gross violations of human rights. A damning example is the court case of Defense for Children International-Palestine v. Biden, where plaintiffs sought to hold the administration of former US President Joe Biden accountable for US support for Israel’s military actions in Gaza, arguing that American aid facilitated acts of genocide.\nDespite acknowledging credible evidence, the court dismissed the case, reaffirming that even in cases involving human rights violations, the executive remains legally unaccountable.\nPresidents’ invocation of national security has long been a pretext for the unchecked expansion of executive authority. Trump, like President George W Bush, has aggressively seized upon this precedent, using it not just for military interventions but also to justify domestic repression. Under the guise of national security, his administration is targeting immigrants and threatening to criminalise dissent.\nThe absolute nature of the president’s pardon power is also troubling. Unlike in other democracies where executive clemency is subject to oversight, the US Constitution imposes no meaningful limits on this power. Trump has taken this to an extreme, granting pardons to political loyalists, war criminals, and insurrectionists. In the hands of an authoritarian president, the pardon becomes a tool for undermining justice and consolidating power.\nThe US Supreme Court, the judicial entity tasked with what is constitutional or not, has historically played a key role in entrenching white supremacy, privilege and inequality in the US.\nIn the court case of Plessy v. Ferguson of 1896, the court provided constitutional legitimacy to racial apartheid, an injustice that persisted well into the 20th century. The legal system did not simply tolerate racial subjugation; it actively upheld and enforced it.\nMeanwhile, the Supreme Court routinely struck down attempts at economic regulation, blocking minimum wage laws, labour protections, and antitrust enforcement on the grounds that such measures violated principles of federalism and the so-called freedom of contract. These rulings were less about protecting liberty and more about shielding the wealthy elite from democratic accountability.\nIt was only during the mid-20th century, particularly under the Warren Court, that the judiciary embraced a rights-based discourse aimed at expanding civil liberties and protecting marginalised communities. Landmark decisions, such as Brown v. Board of Education (1954), Gideon v. Wainwright (1963), Miranda v. Arizona (1966), and Roe v. Wade (1973), did away with the principle of separate but equal in education, entrenched the right to fair trial procedures and a women’s right to reproductive choices. These among other cases signalled a shift towards a more inclusive interpretation of constitutional rights.\nHowever, this period of judicial progress proved short-lived. The elevation of a conservative majority on the Supreme Court has returned the institution to its original DNA — favouring elites to the detriment of women and minorities.\nOver the past two decades, the court has systematically dismantled many gains of the rights revolution, rolling back voting rights, eroding reproductive freedoms, and weakening labour protections.\nThe influence of money in American politics has further cemented this reality, ensuring the government remains beholden to elite interests rather than the electorate. The Supreme Court’s 2010 decision in Citizens United v. FEC accelerated this decline by legalising the unfettered flow of corporate money into political campaigns.\nThe Supreme Court has also played a key role in the expansion of executive power. Nowhere is this clearer than in the Supreme Court’s 2024 decision in Trump v United States, which effectively granted presidents broad immunity from criminal prosecution for actions taken while in office—further insulating the executive branch from legal accountability.\nThe court has also granted the executive nearly unfettered control over law enforcement. In the case of United States v. Nixon (1974), the court reaffirmed that the executive branch holds exclusive authority over prosecutorial decisions, emphasising that the president and the attorney general retain broad discretion in determining whom to prosecute, what charges to bring, and whether to pursue a case.\nSimilarly, in Heckler v. Chaney (1985), the court explicitly held that an agency’s decision not to enforce a law — akin to a prosecutor’s decision not to bring charges — is presumptively unreviewable, as it falls within the realm of executive discretion. Together, these cases reinforced the principle that the executive has nearly absolute discretion in prosecutorial matters, shielded from judicial interference.\nTrump has exploited this fully. He has openly declared his intent to investigate and prosecute political adversaries, threatening the foundational democratic principle of impartial justice. In a constitutional democracy, no individual should live in fear of arbitrary government actions. However, the current legal framework offers little protection. Even if targeted individuals are acquitted, the financial and emotional toll can be devastating.\nTrump is not an aberration, but the predictable product of a system that privileges elites, sustains global domination, and shields the presidency from accountability. The fear many Americans feel today is warranted, but it reflects a deeper misunderstanding: this is not a departure from the norm, but a continuation.\nThe belief that the US Constitution inherently protects against despotism has always been an illusion. From slavery and the genocide of Indigenous peoples to Jim Crow, the internment of Japanese Americans, the Red Scare, the “war on terror”, and repression of dissent against the Israeli genocide of Palestinians, American history reveals that power consistently trumps justice.\nThe stark reality is that the US Constitution, despite its veneration in American political culture, is an outdated and inadequate document for addressing the challenges of the modern world. It was written by and for a narrow class of elites who could not have envisioned a diverse, industrialised, and globally connected society. The structural deficiencies of the constitution — its lack of social and economic protections, its overreliance on an unelected judiciary appointed for life, its reliance on corrosive money in politics, its deeply undemocratic electoral system — have left the country ill-equipped to confront the crises of the 21st century.\nThis is not a fleeting crisis, but the culmination of a constitutional system that was not designed to safeguard against tyranny. The pressing question is no longer whether American democracy is in crisis, but what it will take for the public to confront this sobering reality.\nThe views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

        "headline": "Canada already is America’s 51st state",
        "body": "And that is thanks to a political elite that did not heed prescient warnings.\nFor many Canadians, a thrilling ice hockey game turned out to be an exhilarating antidote to an unforgiving winter.\nMore than that – as a subdued Canadian coach Jon Cooper told reporters after Canada’s best hockey players beat America’s best hockey players in overtime last week – the beleaguered country “needed a win”.\n\n\n\n\nCooper wasn’t asked nor did he elaborate on why Canada had to prevail.\nHe didn’t have to.\nThe reasons were plain to the millions of Canadians who leapt, I reckon, with a mixture of joy and relief when the world’s most gifted hockey player, Connor McDavid, potted the goal that sent his team and a grateful nation into a happy frenzy.\nFor weeks, a blustering US President Donald Trump has taunted Canada and its prime minister. He has referred to a proud people and land as America’s would-be 51st state and Justin Trudeau as its “governor”.\nTrump’s antics and threats have triggered a surge of pride among usually reserved Canadians about their beloved home and worry for its uncertain future.\nAnd the trash-talking leader of Canada’s “dearest” and “closest” ally has proven that most politicians and corporate-hugging columnists have the foresight of Mr Magoo.\nLike the doddering, shortsighted, cartoon character, a host of free-trade-adoring politicos and polemicists refused to see or heed the warnings sounded in the 20th century about the existential risks of tying Canada more tightly into the dominant US economy in the 21st century.\nIt is a remarkable sight to watch, hear, and read Canada’s myopic “intelligentsia” drape themselves in the Maple Leaf while urging the country to “buy Canadian” and fashion other systemic and structural ways to try, belatedly, to curb its dependency on the United States to stave off becoming – officially – America’s 51st state.\nIt is a remarkable sight because, since the early 1980s, the reactionary elites have devoted – without hesitation or regret – their considerable powers and influence to backing every calculated step towards Canada morphing, in effect, into America’s 51st state – economically, culturally, militarily, and diplomatically.\nThe beaming poster boy for this blatant hypocrisy is Ontario’s premier, Doug Ford, who, by conviction and temperament, was all for Donald Trump before he was against him.\nIn a rare moment of sincerity, Ford – the pretend “populist” anointed “Captain Canada” by a gullible and easily impressed establishment press – admitted that he had wanted the havoc-wreaking Trump to return to the White House.\nA crystal ball wasn’t necessary to picture that, given the right conditions, a resource-hungry commander-in-chief with hegemonic aspirations would eventually occupy the Oval Office and attract like-minded acolytes in Canada.\nIn the early 1980s, I was a lowly undergraduate political science student, studying at the University of Toronto.\nOne of my professors was the late and renowned Canadian political economist, Stephen Clarkson.\nProfessor Clarkson was a brilliant teacher and thinker who thought and wrote a lot about Canada’s past, present, and the turbulent waters the country was heading into at that pivotal time.\nI was among the lucky stable of Clarkson’s research assistants when he embarked on writing a book about the perils that the brewing prospects of a free trade deal between Ottawa and Washington – championed by US President Ronald Reagan – posed to Canada’s sovereignty.\nThe book published in 1982 and titled, Canada and the Reagan Challenge, was, at once, a sober rebuttal to the legion of giddy continentalists who were convinced that Canada should deepen its already inexorable links to the United States, as well as a flare that raised the alarm about the country’s fast waning ability to exert any tangible measure of independence at home and abroad.\nWhile Clarkson was a nationalist, he was also a realist. He knew that, by virtue of geography and history, Canada and America were bound to one another.\nStill, he understood the urgent imperative for Canada to look beyond the immediate horizon to broaden trade in existing and emerging markets outside the United States as a means to diversify its export and import policies and, as a result, reduce America’s gravitational pull.\nClarkson’s prescient cautions were dismissed by a smug gallery of “free-trade” apostles as the anachronistic, anti-American “spleen bursts” of an academically trained ostrich opposed to prosperity.\nSo, when Prime Minister Brian Mulroney negotiated a comprehensive free-trade deal with Reagan in 1988 – much of Parliament and the press trumpeted the agreement as a victory of commerce over silly, outdated notions of Canadian autonomy.\nThe 1988 federal election was fought over the potential consequences for Canada of the Mulroney-Reagan pact.\nIn a televised debate, then Liberal leader, John Turner, famously challenged Mulroney – who claimed, absurdly, that the deal could be “cancelled” at any time.\n“With one signature of a pen,” Turner thundered, “you’ve … thrown us into the north-south influence of the United States and will reduce us, I am sure, to a colony of the United States because political independence is sure to follow.”\nTurner’s chest-thumping performance was just that – a performance. The Liberal Party’s opposition to the Mulroney-brokered free-trade accord was a rhetorical pantomime.\nSoon enough, Liberal prime ministers were singing their own fulsome praises of the deal and inviting Mexico to join the continent-wide arrangement consecrated by the smiling, hand-holding “Three Amigos”.\nFast forward to February 2025 and Professor Clarkson’s admonitions and reservations from more than four decades ago have come to fruition.\nAn emboldened US president appears intent on annexing Canada by economic coercion and, given the policy of almost unfettered integration pursued by a succession of Liberal and Conservative governments – and endorsed by starry-eyed editorial writers – Trump has the levers and leverage to do it.\nSuddenly, Clarkson’s critics – inside and outside amnesiac newsrooms and capital cities – are rushing to adopt his “silly, outdated” prescriptions to preserve the nation’s phantom sovereignty and outdo one another as standing on guard for thee – Canada, that is.\nTheir epiphanies are 40 years too late.\nCanada has, by their deliberate design, long been America’s eager, “open for business” vassal.\nThe views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

        "headline": "Imposing tariffs on China will not help resolve the US fentanyl crisis",
        "body": "The tariffs are violating basic principles of the WTO and undermining international and bilateral cooperation.\nOn February 1, the United States government announced a new 10 percent tariff on Chinese imports under the pretext of combatting the proliferation of the opioid fentanyl. The following day, the spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry stated that China firmly deplored and opposed this move and would take necessary countermeasures to defend its legitimate rights and interests.\nIndeed, a new tariff is counterproductive not only when it comes to efforts to rein in the production and distribution of fentanyl but also for bilateral trade relations.\n\n\n\n\nThe US is one of the largest consumers of fentanyl-based drugs in the world and in recent years, their abuse has exacerbated drug addiction and caused many deaths. The crisis has its roots in longstanding opioid use patterns in the country, the profit-driven nature of the US pharmaceutical industry, inadequate public awareness and ineffective social governance.\nChina has some of the world’s toughest counternarcotics policies and laws. In the spirit of humanity and goodwill, China has given support to the US’s response to this issue. At the US’s request, China announced back in 2019 the decision to officially schedule fentanyl-related substances as a class. China has conducted counternarcotics cooperation with the US side in such fields as the scheduling of drug-related substances, intelligence sharing, and cooperation on individual cases.\nYet, the US still insists on dramatising the issue and accuses China of driving its fentanyl crisis. But scapegoating other countries for a domestic crisis will not make the problem disappear; tariffs certainly will not.\nThe unilateral sanctions imposed by the US risk weakening its anti-drug cooperation with China and may also force fentanyl precursor transactions to be conducted on the black market or through third countries, making law enforcement even more difficult.\nFurthermore, these unilateral sanctions imposed violate the basic principles of the World Trade Organization (WTO), of which both China and the US are members. According to the 1947 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) – the precursor to the WHO – trade shall be conducted in a non-discriminatory manner.\nHowever, the unilateral sanctions imposed by the US on specific countries or enterprises essentially constitute discriminatory treatment. This undermines fair competition among WTO members and poses a potential threat to multilateral trade rules.\nAdditionally, the US practices violate the principle of national treatment laid out in Article III of GATT. The article requires that imported products must not be accorded unfavourable treatment based on their origin after entering the territory of a WTO member. The sanctions the US imposed may directly restrict the import of legal drugs or their precursor chemicals, resulting in discrimination against imported goods from China.\nThe US may seek to justify its unilateral tariffs by citing threats to public health or national security, which under GATT can be used to justify tariffs. But to invoke GATT’s Article XX (“General Exceptions”) or Article XXI (“Security Exceptions”), the US would have to demonstrate not only the relevance and necessity of imposing tariffs to protect public health or national security, but also the absence of other less trade-distorting and equally effective means. Factors such as the complexity of the fentanyl crisis and domestic demand make it difficult for the exceptions to be applied.\nThe frequent use of unilateral sanctions by the US not only violates the core rules of the WTO but also disrupts the international trade order and multilateral cooperation. In particular, abusing exception clauses may prompt other countries to question the fairness and efficacy of WTO rules. The possible retaliation in response to US tariffs from other WTO members could lead to a global trade conflict and encourage the trend towards fragmentation of the global trading system.\nIn the long run, the US sanctions will backfire at home as well. Higher tariffs will result in increased prices for imported goods, increasing the burden on American consumers and undercutting the competitiveness of US companies globally.\nThe US needs to view and solve its own fentanyl issue in an objective and rational way instead of threatening other countries with arbitrary tariff hikes. Reducing domestic demand for drugs and enhancing law enforcement cooperation can be effective solutions to the fentanyl crisis.\nTrade and tariff wars have no winners. Pressuring or threatening China is not the right way to engage, as my country will firmly defend its legitimate rights and interests.\nKeeping business ties between China and the US robust serves the fundamental interests of both countries and both peoples, and benefits global economic growth. China hopes the US will work with it to address concerns through equal-footed consultation, maintain the hard-won positive dynamics in counternarcotics cooperation, and jointly promote the steady, sound and sustainable growth of bilateral trade and economic ties.\nThe views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

        "headline": "The lived experiences of communism should serve as a cautionary tale",
        "body": "When searching for a response to the far-right resurgence, Europeans should not look towards the totalitarian left.\nIn Sunday’s general elections in Germany, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) came second for the first time since World War II. Its electoral success is part of a Europe-wide trend of far-right resurgence that has worried many. As a university lecturer, I have observed that as a reaction to this phenomenon, many young people are becoming interested in far-left ideologies, such as communism. Students study Karl Marx as a key political thinker and often admire the old ideas of Marxism and the writings of other communist ideologues for their critique of class relations and capitalism.\nAs young people engage with these ideologies, it is important for them to be aware that they did not remain just theories. Communism was applied as a political ideology of the Marxist-Leninist parties in dozens of countries in Europe and Asia, which resulted in repressive totalitarian regimes.\n\n\n\n\nThe communist regime in my country, Czechia, which in the 1940s was part of an entity called Czechoslovakia, has left a horrific legacy. Today, on the 77th anniversary of the election that brought the communists to power in Prague, I cannot help but think about how the regime scarred the lives of many families, including my own.\nI was born soon after the 1989 Velvet Revolution and grew up hearing about what it was like to live under communism for Czechoslovaks. It was a bleak and oppressive world in which the nationalisation of the means of production in reality meant stealing factories and homes from wealthier citizens so that the state could turn them into farmhouses or residences for top communist state officials. The concepts of fair elections and freedom of speech were mere dreams.\nIn that world, individuals’ opportunities to study, travel, or secure good jobs were often determined by their “unblemished political profile” rather than their abilities. As a result, it was common to find qualified people who disagreed with the regime working in poorly paid and stigmatised jobs, while active members of the Communist Party, despite poor academic performance or lack of experience, occupied top positions. “This all became normal for us. No one believed the totalitarian regime would fall,” my mother told me recently.\nThose who disagreed with or confronted the regime paid a heavy price. There are many accounts in academia and the media of the brutal practices of the State Security (StB) directed at Czechoslovak citizens deemed “enemies of the state”: mass surveillance, blackmail, arrests, torture, execution, and forced emigration. The stories of high-profile dissidents, such as the executed lawyer Milada Horakova or the imprisoned writer Vaclav Havel, who became the first democratically elected Czech president, are well known.\nBut there are many other stories of people who faced repression that remain unknown to the public. The Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes has documented the cases of about 200,000 people arrested in communist Czechoslovakia due to their social class, status, opinions, or religious beliefs. Of these, 4,495 died during their time in prison.\nMy father belongs to this mass of prisoners who are largely unknown. He was labelled “dangerous to communist society” in 1977 and sentenced to 18 months in prison.\nWhen I was in my 20s, I found an old, yellowed paper file hidden in a drawer of the living room table, with the title “Verdict in the Name of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic”. The fading typewritten text revealed that my father, along with his friend, was found guilty of avoiding military service and spreading negative political opinions.\nMy father strongly disagreed with the Communist Party leading the country, and he refused to serve in the army because it had failed in its primary duty to protect the country and its civilians during the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968.\nIn the summer of that year, 200,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union and other communist European countries invaded to suppress the democratic reform movement that was emerging – what came to be known as the Prague Spring. By the end of the year, 137 Czechs and Slovaks were killed. To maintain control in Prague, the Soviet Union permanently stationed troops as an occupying force in the country. Until they withdrew in 1991, Soviet soldiers killed 400 people and raped hundreds of women.\nDespite the brutal violence and crimes, the Communist Party still considered the Warsaw Pact armies to be Czechoslovakia’s allies.\nSo the court condemned my father for “being against the Communist Party and society, damaging relations between the Czechoslovak Army and the Warsaw Pact forces due to his selfish reasons, and being a huge disappointment, given his promising working-class background”. He was just 22 years old and was about to get married to my mother.\nWhen I asked my father about the document and his time in prison, he fell silent. Only my mother shared a few insights: “I was heavily pregnant and lost the baby. Your dad came to see me at the hospital and said he would be leaving for work for some time. Later, I found out he was in prison.”\nMy mother sent my father dozens of letters, but the prison guards did not deliver them. She tried to visit him several times but was not allowed to see him. She would wait outside the prison, hoping to catch a glimpse of him when the prisoners returned from their forced labour. “I saw him once for a few seconds. He was just a thin figure with no hair. He looked exhausted. We waved at each other,” my mother recalled. My father was released after 10 months for good behaviour.\nRecently, I finally managed to persuade my father to visit, with me, the National Security Archive in Prague. We hoped to find more information about who had led his case and who had spied on him – perhaps a friend or even a family member? To our disappointment, the staff handed us a thin file with a note: “The majority of the documents with your father’s name were destroyed by the State Security.”\nTo hide as much of what it did as possible and make people forget, the communist regime destroyed documents just before its collapse. What we did find was a document from a prison guard who had tried to coerce my father into spying on other prisoners.\n“The prisoner is friendly and very popular in the collective, making him a good candidate for delivering information to us. He is emotionally dependent on his fiancee, which can be used against him,” the document read. Perhaps his refusal to become a spy was the main reason why my father was never given any of the letters from my mother and was threatened with solitary confinement.\nMany people, however, collaborated with the regime, which makes it difficult for families to reconcile with loved ones who happened to be on the other side. This collaboration was driven either by belief in political propaganda or by fear of having a “poor political profile”, which could result in job loss or a lack of good prospects for their children. Simply put, families were confronted daily with a horrible choice; their lives were riddled with betrayal and the paranoia of being spied on.\nThis also happened in my own family. For example, while my father was a political prisoner, my mother’s brother was a notorious StB officer who blackmailed people to obtain information on dissidents and contributed to the arrest of many citizens – probably even my father.\nMy paternal grandfather tried to flee the country to West Germany, while one of my uncles from my mother’s side worked in a border guard unit known for shooting and killing people trying to escape the Eastern bloc. My paternal grandmother was an active member of the Communist Party, writing propaganda columns for one of the party newspapers Rudé právo (Red Law) and denying any wrongdoing by the regime, including the arrest of her own son.\nMy father was rehabilitated by a democratic court in 1993 and his criminal record was expunged. My family members who had worked in the security forces were expelled from their positions. However, the choices, beliefs and deeds of the past continue to affect the present.\nThere are many families like mine whose relations continue to be marked by traumatic experiences of communism. Many lost family members or relatives to various forms of political violence, including imprisonment in harsh conditions and executions.\nPeople who read theoretical Marxist and Leninist texts or embrace communist ideas in the Western context – where there is no direct experience with communist regimes – often fail to acknowledge these real histories.\nThis lack of acknowledgement helps sanitise the flaws inherent in communist regimes – which promised to eliminate economic and social inequalities but introduced new ones and, in the process, engaged in grave human rights violations.\nWhen searching for a genuine alternative to the current social and political climate, we must learn from the experiences of those who lived under totalitarian regimes. Major political theories do affect our society, and thus, the lived experiences of those who suffered under such political systems should inform our understanding of them. Only then can we prevent the repetition of historical wrongdoings.\nThe views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

        "headline": "Centring the voiceless: Pope Francis’s enduring global impact",
        "body": "The pontiff’s message of peace and fraternity has challenged the rising tide of nativism, violence and global inequality.\nAccording to Father Gabriel Romanelli, the parish priest of the Church of the Holy Family in Gaza, Pope Francis has been checking up on the long-suffering people of Gaza even from his hospital bed in Rome, where he has been receiving treatment for pneumonia since February 14.\nIn an interview with the Vatican’s official information platform, Vatican News, Romanelli said Francis has maintained nearly daily contact with his church throughout 15 months of massacres, violence, fear and hunger in Gaza and continued to make calls to the parish during his ongoing hospitalisation. “He asked us how we were doing, how the situation was, and he sent us his blessing,” Romanelli said.\n\n\n\n\nAs demonstrated by his attachment to the people of Gaza, Francis believes that those who suffer and who inhabit the existential peripheries of life reflect the true face of God. It is his conviction that the logic of love and life is understood better by fixing the gaze on the poor and the forgotten of society.\nAs such, many Catholics and countless men and women of goodwill around the world are praying for the pope’s quick recovery and return to his mission. They are praying because they know our world can only overcome the polycrisis it is facing today under the guidance of leaders like him – leaders who are driven by a deep concern for those suffering from war, poverty and injustice; leaders who want to advance our common humanity to counter the dangerous rise of nativism, protectionism and parochial nationalism.\nFrancis has demonstrated his unyielding commitment to promoting coexistence and confronting global injustice many times over in the past decade.\nIn February 2019, for example, he signed the Abu Dhabi Declaration on “human fraternity for world peace and living together” alongside Grand Imam of al-Azhar Ahmed Al-Tayyeb.\nThe widely cherished document, in recognising all human beings as brothers and sisters, serves as a guide for future generations to advance a culture of mutual respect. It calls for a “culture of tolerance and of living together in peace” in the name of “all persons of good will present in every part of the world”, but especially “orphans, widows, refugees, those exiled from their homes and countries; victims of wars, persecution, and injustice; those who live in fear, prisoners of war and those being tortured.”\nAfter the Abu Dhabi document came the COVID-19 pandemic, which demonstrated yet again how all humans are held together in a common destiny. Bringing people together in shared suffering, it served to strengthen further Francis’s commitment to spreading his message about our common humanity.\nAs Francis explained in his post-pandemic encyclical, Fratelli Tutti, the pandemic has proven that the global economy is not infallible and that the future of the world cannot be built on economic orthodoxies dictated by market freedom. On the contrary, he suggested, there is the need to recover “a sound political life that is not subject to the dictates of finance”. There is the need, he proposed, for the dismantling of structures of injustice and the irruption of a new moral urgency that “springs from including the excluded in the building of a common destiny” and respecting the dignity and rights of all people everywhere in the world.\nThe world, however, failed to heed Francis’s warning and regrettably learned little from the catastrophe of COVID-19. In fact, social, political and economic conditions of many worsened after the pandemic. Rather than a deeper understanding and greater appreciation of our common humanity and shared destiny, what came to define the post-pandemic world has been more violence, war, nationalism and intolerance. Since the pandemic, social hierarchies have become more rigid, identities more narrow and the already dysfunctional global system even more inclined to fuel division, injustice, poverty, and tensions among nations and peoples.\nFrancis has repeatedly explained in the past few years how the post-pandemic world is living through a “third world war fought piecemeal” that is fuelled by a culture of indifference. He often invited people to cry in the face of the senseless killings of the innocent as he once did while making an appeal for an end to the war in Ukraine. He wept again on the shores of  Lampedusa, Italy, where so many people fleeing wars and poverty have drowned. As the head of the Catholic Church since 2013, Francis has tirelessly expressed his conviction that we are all children of God and every life should be prized rather than priced.\nThese days, he is sending out this message yet again through his daily phone calls to Gaza. These calls, which have continued even from the hospital, are an act of solidarity with Gaza’s hurt, fearful and hungry masses but also an attempt to remind the world of the plight of the people at the existential peripheries.\nThis same desire to place people who are suffering the consequences of war at the centre of global attention had led Francis to make dangerous trips in 2023 to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the site of the longest war in Africa, and to South Sudan, where the people have not experienced any peace, progress or prosperity in more than a decade.\nIn his autobiography, Hope, released in January, Francis further articulates why he is so moved by the suffering of war victims, refugees and migrants. He tells the story of his own family marked by wars, exile, migration, deaths and losses that forced them to undertake the perilous journey from Italy to Argentina. This experience of marginality and precarity, he explains, has shaped his life in his commitment to placing the pain of people suffering in warzones and the anguish of immigrants at the centre of his papacy.\nFrancis has also condemned the world powers for their hypocrisy. This is because, in many of the calamitous wars that he used his position to shed light on, from Gaza and Ukraine to Sudan and Congo, he realised the countries sending humanitarian relief to victims of war are the same countries whose weapons are used to kill and maim the same victims and destroy their societies in the first place. Furthermore, the countries that supply these weapons are often also the ones who refuse to welcome the refugees of war.\nToday, the world needs Francis’s leadership and message of peace, fraternity and solidarity more than ever before. The world is in a crisis that it can get out of only through a paradigm shift from violence to nonviolent ways to heal relations, build trust and address historical injustices. Francis has always been a guiding light to those pushing for this much needed paradigm shift because he has always been consistent in his message that faith and violence are incompatible and that war is always a defeat of humanity.\nThese days, there are many forces around the world pushing for more war, division, confrontation and injustice. Within the same week that Francis sent his blessing to the people of Gaza from his hospital bed in Rome, for example, United States President Donald Trump was still enthusiastically promoting his big plan for their homeland that includes their expulsion.\nWhile Francis was sending a message of hope to those who are suffering and praying for their healing, Trump and his like were working to strengthen their architectures of violence and wishing that the victims of war and the poor would simply disappear.\nAt the end of the day, the most pressing question of our times is how we as humans shall treat our fellow human beings. We can either choose to treat them as people with equal dignity or as nonpersons because of their race, culture, social location or religion. As explained eloquently by philosopher Judith Butler, there are so many victims of violence today who are considered “non-grievable” because the society they exist in has framed them as expendable. When even one person is framed this way in a society, that society loses its recognition that every life matters. As a result, rather than seeing in victims of war and oppression our “shared condition of precariousness”, people, according to Butler, begin to cast the lives of those belonging to certain targeted populations as “not quite lives”. “When such lives are lost,” Butler writes, “they are not grievable, since, in the twisted logic that rationalizes their death, the loss of such populations is deemed necessary to protect the lives of the ‘living’.”\nIn a world where too many lives, including those in Gaza, have been deemed “ungrievable” by so many in our societies, Francis is a beacon of light reminding us of our common humanity and shared destiny. No one knows how much longer he has left on this Earth, but it is clear that his legacy of centring the poor, the weak and the needy and yearning for peace, fraternity and coexistence in the face of deepening divisions and increasing violence will surely outlive him.\nThe views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

        "headline": "A flawed peace deal would not end the war in Ukraine",
        "body": "Western policymakers should consider what happened with the Minsk agreements when talking peace in Ukraine.\nToday, we mark three years of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. For three years, the Ukrainian people have demonstrated remarkable resilience, foiling Russian plans to conquer Kyiv and forcing its army to retreat from Kharkiv and Kherson.\nUkrainians continue to resist against the onslaught of the Russian army, but the war has inevitably entered a grinding phase in which every territorial gain comes at an enormous cost, testing Ukraine’s endurance and the West’s willingness to maintain support.\n\n\n\n\nAt this critical stage, a new administration in the United States has signalled a dramatic shift in its policy on Ukraine, demanding that a swift peace agreement be reached. Last week, US and Russian officialsmet in Saudi Arabiafor direct negotiations without Ukraine at the table. This meeting and the rhetoric coming from Washington have raised fears that President Donald Trump’s administration is laying the groundwork for broader concessions in the name of de-escalation with Russia.\nFor Ukraine, the fundamental issue is not whether diplomacy should be pursued – any war eventually ends at the negotiating table – but what terms those negotiations will involve. If the priority is simply to stop the fighting as quickly as possible, there is a risk of Ukraine being pressured into accepting a settlement that does not address its long-term security concerns and that temporarily freezes the war rather than putting an end to it.\nRecent history provides a clear warning against such flawed “peacemaking”. In February 2014, Russia invaded Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula and occupied it; two months later, its troops along with local pro-Russia forces launched an operation in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region, taking control of some territory. In August, Kyiv was forced into negotiations brokered by France and Germany that aimed to put a stop to the fighting under unfavourable terms.\nWhat came to be known as the Minsk I agreement, signed in September of that year, lasted no more than six months. In January 2015, forces loyal to Moscow and regular Russian army units renewed their attacks on Ukraine to force it into more concessions. In February 2015, what came to be known as the Minsk II agreement was negotiated and signed, stipulating that Kyiv had to recognise the “special status” of two regions in the Donbas in effect occupied by Russia.\nThe Minsk agreements ultimately failed to secure a durable peace. Structured to freeze the conflict rather than resolve it, they allowed Russia to consolidate control over the occupied territories while keeping Ukraine politically and militarily constrained. Moscow never adhered to its commitments, using the diplomatic process to buy time, regroup and prepare for further aggression.\nThe failed Minsk agreements serve as a cautionary tale: Settlements that ignore Ukraine’s security realities and societal expectations do not lead to lasting peace but merely postpone the next conflict.\nAny settlement must reflect the will of the people who have endured this war for three years.  Polls conducted in Ukraine show clearly what the Ukrainians want.\nWar fatigue is real, as illustrated by a poll conducted byGallupin November, in which 52 percent of respondents said they supported negotiations. However, when it comes to any territorial concessions, only 27 percent said Ukraine should consider such a step. A clear majority of Ukrainians reject giving up any land as part of a peace agreement.\nThese figures highlight an inescapable political reality: There is no broad support in Ukraine for a peace agreement that legitimises Russian territorial gains. Any Ukrainian leadership attempting to negotiate such terms would face enormous public pressure. And even if an agreement were reached at the diplomatic level, attempts to implement it would be met with fierce resistance domestically.\nThat is why US and other Western policymakers advocating for an expedited resolution cannot ignore the will of the Ukrainian people. If they do want a peace deal to hold, they should consider continuing support for the Ukrainian army. Ukraine’s ability to negotiate from a position of strength depends on continued military success and a unified stance from its allies.\nIn making decisions on their Ukraine policy, Western countries should not fall for Russia’s flawed narrative. Moscow has been trying to create the illusion of strength while concealing its growing vulnerabilities.\nRussian officials have insisted the Russian economy is stable despite sanctions, their military operations are sustainable and time is on their side. At the Riyadh talks, Russian representatives reportedly suggested that businesses in Moscow are thriving, restaurants are full and only Western economies are suffering from prolonged engagement in Ukraine.\nThe message was clear: Russia can fight for as long as it takes while the West faces diminishing returns. This framing has led some in the West to conclude that a quick peace deal – one based on Ukrainian concessions – may be the most pragmatic way forward.\nBut it is not. Appeasing Russia would only increase its appetite for more aggression.\nThe way to guarantee peace in Ukraine is by setting up a robust post-war security framework. Whether through NATO integration, bilateral defence agreements or a structured European-led security framework, Ukraine needs concrete security commitments. If these are absent in any peace settlement, the risk of renewed conflict would remain high.\nThe coming months will be critical as Washington reassesses its role in Ukraine. While much is unknown, one reality is clear: Ukraine’s fight is not only about reclaiming lost territory but also about ensuring that its sovereignty is no longer in question. Whether Western policy continues to align with that goal or shifts towards a more transactional approach will shape the next phase of the war.\nThe views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

        "headline": "US-Ukraine critical minerals deal: What we know so far",
        "body": "Zelenskyy might visit Trump this week for a rare earth minerals deal in efforts to win Washington’s backing for Kyiv.\nUS President Donald Trump on Tuesday said that the United States and Ukraine had agreed to a draftcritical mineralsdeal that, according to the president, could be worth about $1 trillion. The proposed deal is seen by many analysts as an attempt by Kyiv to win the support of the new US administration amid tensions over Washington’s outreach to Moscow to end the Ukraine war.\nThe apparent deal comes a week after Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy rejected an earlier draft. The Ukrainian leader had earlier aired his grievance against being left out of US-Russia talks to end the Ukraine war. On Wednesday, Zelenskyy described the agreement as aramework economic deal, and said that so far, Kviv had not secured any security guarantees from the US.\nIn recent days, the public rift between Trump and Zelenskyy hadescalated into a war of words, raising concerns in Kyiv and European capitals that Trump might rush through a deal with Moscow to end the war on Russia’s terms.\nHere is what we know so far:\nTrump told reporters at the Oval Office on Tuesday that Zelenskyy wants to visit Washington on Friday to sign a“very big deal.”\n“I hear that he is coming on Friday. Certainly, it’s OK with me if he would like to. And he would like to sign it together with me, and I understand that’s a big deal.”\nTrump said the deal could be worth up to $1 trillion, and that American taxpayers would get their money back.\nOn Wednesday evening, Zelenskyy said that the agreement — which he said was an economic framework for cooperation with the US — did not, as of now, include any US security guarantees.\nHowever, according to the Reuters news agency, the draft deal did say that the US wants Ukraine to be “free, sovereign and secure”. An earlier draft deal was rejected by Zelenskyy last week because it lacked details about security guarantees for Ukraine, according to media reports. The details of the draft deal have not been shared publicly.\nOn Monday, Zelenskyy said that he wasready to resignfor the sake of peace but demanded that Kyiv should be granted membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) as a way to ensure his country’s security. But Washington has dubbed the NATO membership demand “unrealistic”.\n“This is hugely significant, because certainly, according to the Ukrainians we’ve been speaking to all week, this [deal] is seen as a means for Donald Trump to basically get what he wants,” Al Jazeera’s Charles Stratford said.\nThe deal is “looking at harvesting up to 50 percent of Ukraine’s minerals and rare earth materials”, said Stratford, reporting from Kyiv, adding that the timeframe is uncertain.\nRare earth mineralsare a group of 17 heavy metals found in the Earth’s crust globally. Some of the rare earth elements such as neodymium, lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, yttrium, terbium and europium are used in the manufacture of high-tech products such as computer hard drives, television and mobile screens and camera lenses.\nThe US president has said that he seeks minerals from Kyiv in return for billions of dollars of aid Washington has provided in the past three years of war against Russia.\nEarlier this month, he told reporters in the White House that he wants “equalisation” for the close to $375.8bn Washington has sent Ukraine. He reiterated this on Tuesday, saying: “We’re spending hundreds of billions of dollars on Russia and Ukraine fighting a war that should have never, ever happened.”\nTrump’s estimates of aid sent to Kyiv contradict data from the US government itself. The US disbursed $183bn to aid Ukraine as of September 30, 2024, according to Ukraine Oversight, a website created by the US government to record aid sent to Ukraine.\nCurrently, the largest producer of rare earth minerals is China, extracting at least 60 percent of the world’s supply and processing at least 90 percent of it with a near monopoly, the Center for Strategic and International Studies reported in 2024.\nAccording to the US Geological Survey, the US was dependent on China, Malaysia, Japan and Estonia for 80 percent of its rare earth needs in 2024.\nSince taking office on January 20, Trump hasimposed tariffson allies such as Canada as well as China, Washington’s biggest rival, shaking global markets.\nHis push to get a rare earth deal with Kyiv is part of his agenda to make the US the hub of big tech. During his campaign, he also accused another close US ally, Taiwan, of stealing the US’s chip business. He threatened to impose tariffs on Taiwan, a major exporter of computer chips. Amid the tariff threats, Taiwan pledged to boost investment in the US.\nLast month, Trump announced that the private sector would invest $500bn in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure in the country. On Tuesday, Apple Inc announced it would invest $500bn amid pressure from Trump, who has demanded that corporations manufacture in the US to create jobs for Americans. Apple devices, including its bestseller iPhone, are mostly manufactured in China.\n“Donald Trump appears to have broken all norms in international policy by doing this, and he’s losing a lot of US soft power by being so transactional,” Theresa Fallon, director of the Centre for Russia Europe Asia Studies and a senior fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, told Al Jazeera.\n“It’s OK to be transactional,” said Fallon, but “this is just extortion”, she said.\nUkraine has 22 elements out of the 34 substances that the European Union defines as “critical raw materials”, and the country’s reserves account for around five percent of global stock, the Russian language service of the United Nations news reported in 2022.\n“About five percent of all the world’s ‘critical raw materials’ are located in Ukraine, which occupies only 0.4 percent of the Earth’s surface,” Svetlana Grinchuk, Ukraine’s deputy minister of environmental protection and natural resources, said during a UN meeting in 2022. With an area of a little over 600,000sq km (232,000sq miles), Ukraine is Europe’s largest country by area, outside Russia.\nAccording to a report by the Ukrainian Geological Survey, Ukraine accounts for seven percent of the global production of titanium. The report adds that the reserves discovered in Ukraine are equal to 15 years of production of titanium globally. Ukraine also has reserves of graphite, nickel and cobalt.\nUkraine has said that its rare earth minerals and other critical minerals, such as tantalum, niobium, and beryllium, are in six locations across the country.\n\nUkraine’s President Zelenskyy on Wednesday confirmed that there was an agreement on the table, but framed it as a broader economic partnership initiative than as just a minerals deal.\nHe also confirmed that Ukraine does not have, so far, any security guarantees against Russian aggression.\n“I didn’t let the ministers sign a relevant agreement because in my view it is not ready to protect us, our interest,” Zelenskyy was quoted as saying by the Associated Press during the Munich Security Conference on February 15.\nUkraine has been demanding entry into NATO to ensure its security as Moscow occupies large swathes of Ukraine, including Crimea, which it annexed in 2014.\nLast week, Zelenskyy reiterated his opposition to the deal under which the US sought rights to $500bn in Ukraine’s natural wealth. He also questioned Trump’s assertion that Washington had given more than $350b in aid to Kyiv.\n“One cannot count up to $500bn and say, ‘Give us back $500bn in minerals.’ That’s not a serious discussion,” Zelenskyy said on February 19.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron appeared to have backed the rare earth deal. “Macron himself endorsed this plan, he saw it as being something as significant, that could potentially lead to the beginnings of a true peace negotiation,” Al Jazeera’s Stratford said.\nMacron also backed Trump’s peace efforts, but cautioned against a deal at the cost of Ukraine’s “surrender”.\n“This peace must allow for Ukrainian sovereignty and allow Ukraine to negotiate with other stakeholders,” Macron said after meeting with Trump in Washington.\nMacron was on adiplomatic visitto Washington after Trump excluded Ukraine as well as European leaders from the Ukraine peace talks. Washington’s NATO allies were also blindsided by Trump’s overture to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Macron also organised two meetings as European leaders scrambled for responses in the wake of Trump’s dramatic policy shift on Ukraine.\nEurope has been divided on its response to Trump’s peace move as well as his demands that Ukraine’s security should be guaranteed by European nations. Trump believes the US is picking up almost the entire tab to support Ukraine and wants Europe to take the driver’s seat.\nTrump has backed the idea of European nations contributing to “a form of peacekeeping that’s acceptable to everybody”, though the Kremlin has opposed any European force in Ukraine.\nThe United Kingdom and Sweden have offered to deploy troops in Ukraine as part of a future peace deal, but Germany, the eurozone’s biggest economy, is opposed to the idea. During his meeting with Trump, Macron said European countries “need to do more … to more fairly share the security burden”.\nEuropean nations are also considering increasing their defence spending – which has been demanded by Trump.\nOutgoing German Chancellor Olaf Scholz criticised Trump’s push for the rare earth deal as “very egotistic” and “very self-centred”. Scholz has argued that Ukraine requires its natural resources to rebuild from the ravages caused by war.\nFriedrich Merz, leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) which won Germany’s election on Sunday, has slammed Trump’s attacks on Zelenskyy.\n“After [President] Donald Trump’s remarks last week … it is clear that this government does not care much about the fate of Europe,” he said,calling for German “independence” from the US.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

        "headline": "‘Propaganda lessons for everyone’: Russia’s wartime curriculum exposed",
        "body": "An employee of a Russian school was tasked to film the implementation of a new syllabus. He shared the footage with an American filmmaker and fled.\nIn Pavel Talankin’s film, Mr. Nobody Against Putin, one scene depicts Russian schoolteachers struggling to explain the reasons for Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine to their pupils, early on in the war.\nOne cannot say “denazification”, a word the Kremlin often uses to justify its onslaught. Later, though, a history teacher displays no hesitation.\n“The economic component of hybrid warfare, these are the sanctions against our country,” he tells a class of 12- and 13-year-olds. “You already know that Europe, not Russia, is suffering the most from these sanctions now … There are no local agricultural products: No wheat, oils and so on. Well, OK, in France they’re used to eating oysters and frogs. They will last for some time. But what about the others, like England?”\nSince the war erupted three years ago, classrooms, lecture halls and even kindergartens across Russia have reflected the new normal in a militarised syllabus that critics accuse of indoctrinating children into a warlike ideology.\nTalankin’s documentary aims to expose how the “special military operation”, as the invasion is officially termed, has spilled over into the nation’s schools.\n“Wars are won not by commanders, but by schoolteachers,” Russian President Vladimir Putin says in archival footage in the film.\nFrom 2018, Talankin had worked at the Karabash Primary School #1, in a small industrial town of the same name in the Ural mountains. He planned events like concerts and school discos and was also the school’s designated videographer.\nSoon after the war started, he was instructed by the Ministry of Education to film how the new patriotic programme was being implemented at his school.\nBut he told Al Jazeera that since he felt “broken” at the news of the invasion and found it “incomprehensible” that he would be forced to take part in a pro-war agenda, he secretly shared the footage with American filmmaker David Borenstein.\nHe has described himself as feeling like “these kids’ propagandist”.\n“At the beginning of the war, various special events were held to support the soldiers and the military,” said Talankin.\n“The children had to sing songs, read poems, cut out some pigeons and stick them on the windows. My task was to shoot it all and publish it with hashtags … so that the public got the impression that everyone supports it en masse.”\nThe Russian education system has been overhauled since 2022.\nHistory lessons have been reframed around the Kremlin’s current geopolitical outlook. A number of schools now host mini-museums and exhibitions about the war. One school in rural Bashkortostan has hung portraits of local soldiers who have died on the front lines, as well as everyday objects from the battles such as wet wipes.\nWeekly classes were introduced in 2022, under the banner “Important Conversations”. They emphasise the importance of duty to one’s country and themes of self-sacrifice and military history, such as Soviet heroics in World War II. They have even been taught in kindergartens. Each lesson is preceded by raising the flag and performing the Russian national anthem.\n“It was every Monday, at first, and then Thursdays as well,” Talankin said. “The classes were planned completely, from start to finish: What should the teacher say, and when? What questions should be asked of the children? What presentations should be used? Everything is well thought-out, and I was a little offended, [and felt] sorry for the teachers because we do not have adequate equipment at school. There are no textbooks, there are no manuals for teachers. In the same way, they could explain physics, they could do [any other subject] like this, but this is not the case. But they have all this strength for propaganda.”\nIn his film, one teacher is seen telling a group of bored-looking children, “If you live in our country and don’t love it, then you’re a parasite. Leave.”\nIn addition, extracurricular activities such as drills and parades led by veterans who have served in Ukraine, grenade-throwing contests, and classes to instil discipline in students are all aimed at stoking patriotic fervour.\nSince 2023, military training, including firearms, has been reintroduced in schools, a practice from the Soviet era.\nA representative of the Education Ministry told Al Jazeera in an email that Moscow is “implementing a number of educational projects aimed at shaping the worldview of Russian citizens”.\n“The most optimal conditions for accumulating impressions, forming ideas, and nurturing children’s feelings are created at primary school age,” they said. “It is at this age, when a person begins to form as an individual, that it is important to explain to him what the all-Russian civic identity is. Patriotism is one of the most important spiritual and moral values, which is rooted in the history of the people and the state.”\nThey added that it is “important to instil in the younger generation of children a sense of love for the Motherland, a sense of duty to the Fatherland and respect for the history and traditions of their native country”.\nIn another scene of Talankin’s film, students sit through a presentation by the mercenary outfit Wagner Group, fully kitted out in camouflage and berets, and pass around a landmine. In another, a group of frustrated teachers lament that there is hardly time left for regular classes.\n“The purpose of militarising both the school curriculum and extracurricular life for Russian children is explicitly aimed at raising a large number of indoctrinated young Russians ready to serve in the military and support the state’s aggressive military expansionism,” Ian Garner, historian of Russia and author of the book Z Generation: Into the Heart of Russia’s Fascist Youth, told Al Jazeera.\n“These policies are being adopted with one eye on the long-term: not the war against Ukraine, but the next war in five, 10, or 15 years’ time. Russia’s sociocultural fabric is being totally reshaped and militarised. Children’s education is a vital component of this.”\nIn the film, the history teacher professes a fascination with Lavrentiy Beria, the notorious chief of Josef Stalin’s secret police and the architect of the Gulag system, among other Soviet officials.\n“History lessons in Russia now teach national and quasi-religious myths about the country’s messianic destiny, past imperial glory, and exceptional military history,” continued Garner.\n“Most notable in this is the rehabilitation of Joseph Stalin, who is portrayed as the wise leader who transformed the country’s economy, united the Soviet peoples, and saved the world in World War II. The terrors and purges of the 1930s, let alone crimes like the Holodomor, are completely absent,” he said, referring to the mass famine in Soviet Ukraine from 1932 to 1933.\nGarner believes that while many students are probably jaded with the material, together with the barrage of pro-war messages through Russian society and social media, the system is at least partly successful in raising a generation of militaristic young nationalists.\n“It all depends on their age,” said Talankin. “Small children are very receptive to the words of the teacher: They trust them very much.”\nAccording to him, some educators still try to subvert or play down the Important Conversations classes.\n“There are teachers who resist a little,” he said.\n“For example, they’ll say today we are talking about something important … and we are talking about important mathematics, for example. But this is rare. I really feel sorry for the teachers. They are like hostages in captivity, forced to say all sorts of things.”\nResisting the Kremlin’s orders in education comes with personal and professional risk.\nTeachers expressing views contradicting the official position have found themselves denounced by parents, pro-Kremlin campaigners and even their pupils. In some cases, their colleagues have turned against them, leading to them being fined or prosecuted for “discrediting” the Russian armed forces.\nIn Crimea, activists have targeted teachers for displaying a Ukrainian flag on social media, tracking them down and coercing them into filming an apology video which is then circulated over social media. Sometimes the harassment continues even after that, until the teacher loses their job.\nHowever, according to independent human rights monitor OVD-Info, which tracks politically motivated persecution in Russia, by 2024 the number of teachers being penalised dropped sharply, perhaps indicating a climate of self-censorship or fear.\nTalankin, who quit his job and fled Russia in 2024, said some of his students have since enlisted in the army.\nHis film, which has played at international film festivals, has stirred controversy in his hometown.\n“The reactions are varied,” he reflected glumly. “From calling me scum and a b*****d and a traitor to Russia to, ‘Well done, you finally showed this swamp.’ I would like everyone to watch it, both in Russia and the world. There is a lot of love in it: To the country, to the homeland. But not to Putin’s Russia. Because it clearly shows how Putin destroys everything alive.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

        "headline": "‘Propaganda lessons for everyone’: Russia’s wartime curriculum exposed",
        "body": "An employee of a Russian school was tasked to film the implementation of a new syllabus. He shared the footage with an American filmmaker and fled.\nIn Pavel Talankin’s film, Mr. Nobody Against Putin, one scene depicts Russian schoolteachers struggling to explain the reasons for Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine to their pupils, early on in the war.\nOne cannot say “denazification”, a word the Kremlin often uses to justify its onslaught. Later, though, a history teacher displays no hesitation.\n“The economic component of hybrid warfare, these are the sanctions against our country,” he tells a class of 12- and 13-year-olds. “You already know that Europe, not Russia, is suffering the most from these sanctions now … There are no local agricultural products: No wheat, oils and so on. Well, OK, in France they’re used to eating oysters and frogs. They will last for some time. But what about the others, like England?”\nSince the war erupted three years ago, classrooms, lecture halls and even kindergartens across Russia have reflected the new normal in a militarised syllabus that critics accuse of indoctrinating children into a warlike ideology.\nTalankin’s documentary aims to expose how the “special military operation”, as the invasion is officially termed, has spilled over into the nation’s schools.\n“Wars are won not by commanders, but by schoolteachers,” Russian President Vladimir Putin says in archival footage in the film.\nFrom 2018, Talankin had worked at the Karabash Primary School #1, in a small industrial town of the same name in the Ural mountains. He planned events like concerts and school discos and was also the school’s designated videographer.\nSoon after the war started, he was instructed by the Ministry of Education to film how the new patriotic programme was being implemented at his school.\nBut he told Al Jazeera that since he felt “broken” at the news of the invasion and found it “incomprehensible” that he would be forced to take part in a pro-war agenda, he secretly shared the footage with American filmmaker David Borenstein.\nHe has described himself as feeling like “these kids’ propagandist”.\n“At the beginning of the war, various special events were held to support the soldiers and the military,” said Talankin.\n“The children had to sing songs, read poems, cut out some pigeons and stick them on the windows. My task was to shoot it all and publish it with hashtags … so that the public got the impression that everyone supports it en masse.”\nThe Russian education system has been overhauled since 2022.\nHistory lessons have been reframed around the Kremlin’s current geopolitical outlook. A number of schools now host mini-museums and exhibitions about the war. One school in rural Bashkortostan has hung portraits of local soldiers who have died on the front lines, as well as everyday objects from the battles such as wet wipes.\nWeekly classes were introduced in 2022, under the banner “Important Conversations”. They emphasise the importance of duty to one’s country and themes of self-sacrifice and military history, such as Soviet heroics in World War II. They have even been taught in kindergartens. Each lesson is preceded by raising the flag and performing the Russian national anthem.\n“It was every Monday, at first, and then Thursdays as well,” Talankin said. “The classes were planned completely, from start to finish: What should the teacher say, and when? What questions should be asked of the children? What presentations should be used? Everything is well thought-out, and I was a little offended, [and felt] sorry for the teachers because we do not have adequate equipment at school. There are no textbooks, there are no manuals for teachers. In the same way, they could explain physics, they could do [any other subject] like this, but this is not the case. But they have all this strength for propaganda.”\nIn his film, one teacher is seen telling a group of bored-looking children, “If you live in our country and don’t love it, then you’re a parasite. Leave.”\nIn addition, extracurricular activities such as drills and parades led by veterans who have served in Ukraine, grenade-throwing contests, and classes to instil discipline in students are all aimed at stoking patriotic fervour.\nSince 2023, military training, including firearms, has been reintroduced in schools, a practice from the Soviet era.\nA representative of the Education Ministry told Al Jazeera in an email that Moscow is “implementing a number of educational projects aimed at shaping the worldview of Russian citizens”.\n“The most optimal conditions for accumulating impressions, forming ideas, and nurturing children’s feelings are created at primary school age,” they said. “It is at this age, when a person begins to form as an individual, that it is important to explain to him what the all-Russian civic identity is. Patriotism is one of the most important spiritual and moral values, which is rooted in the history of the people and the state.”\nThey added that it is “important to instil in the younger generation of children a sense of love for the Motherland, a sense of duty to the Fatherland and respect for the history and traditions of their native country”.\nIn another scene of Talankin’s film, students sit through a presentation by the mercenary outfit Wagner Group, fully kitted out in camouflage and berets, and pass around a landmine. In another, a group of frustrated teachers lament that there is hardly time left for regular classes.\n“The purpose of militarising both the school curriculum and extracurricular life for Russian children is explicitly aimed at raising a large number of indoctrinated young Russians ready to serve in the military and support the state’s aggressive military expansionism,” Ian Garner, historian of Russia and author of the book Z Generation: Into the Heart of Russia’s Fascist Youth, told Al Jazeera.\n“These policies are being adopted with one eye on the long-term: not the war against Ukraine, but the next war in five, 10, or 15 years’ time. Russia’s sociocultural fabric is being totally reshaped and militarised. Children’s education is a vital component of this.”\nIn the film, the history teacher professes a fascination with Lavrentiy Beria, the notorious chief of Josef Stalin’s secret police and the architect of the Gulag system, among other Soviet officials.\n“History lessons in Russia now teach national and quasi-religious myths about the country’s messianic destiny, past imperial glory, and exceptional military history,” continued Garner.\n“Most notable in this is the rehabilitation of Joseph Stalin, who is portrayed as the wise leader who transformed the country’s economy, united the Soviet peoples, and saved the world in World War II.

        "body": "This month marks 140 years since Western powers sidelined Africans and carved up ‘ownership’ of the continent among themselves.\nIt was the late 19th century and European nations were beginning to look at the African continent as a more permanent resource base for their newly growing industrial sectors.\nMore than the ongoing trade between the two continents that had run for decades, though, the Europeans wanted direct control of Africa’s natural resources. In addition, these countries aimed to “develop and civilise Africa”, according to documents from that period.\nThus began the mad “Scramble for Africa”, as it would later be called. Great Britain, Portugal, France, Germany, and King Leopold II of Belgium began sending scouts to secure trade and sovereignty treaties with local leaders, buying or simply staking flags and laying claim to vast expanses of territory crisscrossing the continent rich with resources from palm oil to rubber.\nSquabbles soon erupted in Europe overwho “owned” what. The French, for example, clashed with Britain over several West African territories, and again with King Leopold over Central African regions.\nTo avoid an all-out conflict between the rival European nations, all stakeholders agreed to a meeting in Berlin, Germany in 1884-1885 to set out common terms and manage the colonisation process.\nNo African nations were invited or represented.\nIn November 1884, German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck took up the task of calling for and hosting the conference in Berlin at the Reich Chancellery, his official residence on 77 William Street.\nFor months leading up to that, French officials, in missives to Bismarck, had raised worries about Britain’s gains, especially its control of Egypt and the Suez Canal transport route. Germany, too, was worried about conflicting areas with the British, such as Cameroon.\nThe Bismarck-led talks lasted from November 15, 1884 until February 26, 1885. On the agenda was the clear mapping and agreement of who owned which area. Regions of tax-free commerce and free navigation, particularly in the Congo and Niger River basins, were also to be clarified.\nAmbassadors and diplomats from 14 countries were present at the meeting.\nFour of them – France, Germany, Britain, and Portugal – already controlled the most African territory and were thus the chief stakeholders.\nBelgium’s King Leopold also sent emissaries to secure recognition of the “International Congo Society”, an association formed to establish his personal control of the Congo Basin.\nNo African leader was present. A request by the Sultan of Zanzibar to attend was dismissed.\nAside from those were nine other countries, most of whom would end up leaving the conference with no territory at all. They were:\n\n\n\nOver three months of haggling, European leaders signed and ratified a General Act of 38 clauses that legalised and sealed the partition of Africa. The US ended up not signing the treaty because domestic politics at the time began to take an anti-imperialist turn.\nWestern “ownership” of African territories was not finalised at the conference, but after several bilateral events that followed. Liberia was the only country not partitioned because it had gained independence from the US. Ethiopia was briefly invaded by Italy, but resisted colonisation for the most part. After the German and Ottoman empires fell following World War I, a map closer to what we now know as Africa would emerge.\nThis list illustrates which colonial rulers claimed the continent in the early 20th Century:\nHistorians point out that unlike what is widely believed, the Berlin Conference did not kick-start the colonisation process; instead, it accelerated it.\nWhile only about 20 percent of Africa – mainly the coastal parts of the continent – had already been staked by European powers before the conference, by 1890, five years after it, about 90 percent of African territory was colonised, including inland nations.\nColonialists were believed to have largely disregarded previous alignments and grouped peoples of different cultures and languages together, even groups that were never friendly towards each other.\nBut there are also those, like researcher Jack Paine, who say the conference itself was of little consequence: That some African countries were already mapped out in earlier expeditions, and that many of the borders we recognise now would not be formalised until much later.\n“The Conference itself established little in the way of making states, with the lone exception of creating today’s Democratic Republic of the Congo,” Paine, a political studies lecturer at Emory University told Al Jazeera, referring to the then Congo Free State.\n“The reason the conference convened in the first place was because Europeans had already initiated a ‘scramble’ for African territory,” he added. “It is difficult to give much credence to the standard idea that the Berlin Conference was a seminal event in the European partition of Africa.”\nPaine, and many other political scientists, however, agree that colonisation determined the future of the continent in ways that continue to have profound geo-political effects on today’s Africa.\nResources were looted; culture and resistance subjugated.\nEven after African leaders successfully fought for independence and most countries became liberated between the 1950s and 1970s, building free nations was difficult due to thedamage of colonisation, researchers say.\nBecause of colonialism, Africa “had acquired a legacy of political fragmentation that could neither be eliminated nor made to operate satisfactorily”, researchers Jan Nijman, Peter Muller and Harm de Blij wrote in their 1997 book Realms, Regions, and Concepts.\nFollowing independence, civil wars broke out across the continent, and in many instances, caused armies to take power, for example in Nigeria and Ghana. Political theorists link that to the fact that most groups were forced to work together for the first time, causing conflict.\nMeanwhile, military governments would continue to rule many countries for years, stunting political and economic development in ways that are still obvious today, scholars say. Former colonies such as Mali and Burkina Faso, both led by the military, have now turned against France because of perceived political interference they say is an example of neo-colonialism.\nIn a famous quote, Julius Nyerere, the former Tanzanian president, articulated what researchers agree is the current state of Africa: “We have artificial ‘nations’ carved out at the Berlin Conference in 1884, and today we are struggling to build these nations into stable units of human society … We are in danger of becoming the most Balkanised continent of the world.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

        "headline": "The colonial partition that keeps Cameroon split along ‘artificial lines’",
        "body": "A century ago, Germany, France and Britain claimed the country at different times. The scars remain visible in conflicts today.\nTiko, Cameroon –On a warm day in Mudeka, an English-speaking village across the river from Cameroon’s Francophone region, supercentenarian Atemafac Anathasia Tanjuh pieces together snippets of her childhood memories.\nTanjuh, whose family says she is about 120 years old, is one of the last living witnesses to European colonial rule in Africa and her Bangwa people’s fierce resistance against German colonisation.\n“They imposed their rules on us,” Tanjuh said, surrounded by one of her five surviving children and some great-grandchildren, her voice laced with both nostalgia and resilience. After European powers split up Africa during the1884-1885 Berlin Conference, Cameroon became a German protectorate until after World War I (WWI), when it was carved up between Britain and France.\nTanjuh said her people endured harsh times under the Germans, but the true weight of imperial rule grew much heavier under the French and British – the remnants of which leave Cameroon deeply divided and at war today.\nWhen the English and French first partitioned the country in 1919, Tanjuh’s community found itself torn apart.\n“We could no longer move from Fontem [which was under British rule] to the market in Dschang [which was under French rule], where I used to go to sell cocoyam and palm kernel,” she said. The divisions severed ties with their historical trading partners and relatives on the other side.\nAs the years progressed, the divide became more than merely physical – also linguistic and cultural. After independence in the 1960s, Cameroon maintained its French-majority culture, while those in the Anglophone regions felt increasingly marginalised.\nThis escalated, eventually manifesting in a violent conflict between Anglophone armedseparatistsand Francophone state-armed troops, which has killed more than 6,500 and displaced about 700,000 people in the southwest and northwest of the country since late 2016.\nAt the sound of gunfire from the separatist clashes today, Tanjuh is drawn swiftly back to her memories of World War I, her daughter says. “Let’s hide in the caves to stay safe, just like we did back then,” the elder tells her family, her instincts sharp and honed by a lifetime of turmoil.\nBefore European colonisation, Cameroon was a rich tapestry of independent kingdoms, each with its own territory, leadership, culture and traditions. However, this intricate web of societies was upended in 1884 when Germany annexed the region, unifying it under a single colony named Kamerun. This move was cemented by the arbitrary partition of Africa at the Berlin Conference – an exclusive gathering of European powers and the United States, which concluded exactly 140 years ago this week.\nThe aftermath of World War I further reshaped Cameroon’s destiny. Germany’s defeat led to the colony being seized and divided in 1919 between Britain and France, this time in Versailles. The partition was drawn up by representatives of the two powers – who, notably, had little firsthand knowledge of the land or its people.\nThe Picot Line, named after French representative Georges Picot (who also negotiated theSykes-Picot Agreementthat split up the Ottoman Empire after WWI) and negotiated with British delegate Lancelot Oliphant, arbitrarily split Cameroonian communities that shared common ethnic, linguistic and cultural heritage. As a result, communities like the Mbo people, for example, speak English in the Kupe Muanenguba Division but French just across the Mungo River.\nPaul Nchoji Nkwi, a retired professor of African anthropology at the University of Yaounde I, highlights that before the Berlin Conference, there was no attempt to study Africa’s ethnographic composition so as to create meaningful borders.\n“They simply drew straight lines,” he said, pointing out that many Cameroonian ethnic groups, such as the Efik, have close relatives across the border in Nigeria. “If you look at most maps, especially in West Africa, the boundaries are straight, artificial lines. Yet, despite this, ethnic groups have remained culturally connected.”\nThe wave of liberation movements in the 1960s finally brought political independence. French Cameroon gained independence in 1960, followed by British Cameroon in 1961, leading to their reunification as a federal state. However, this process was fraught with challenges.\nThe colonial legacy – particularly the forced imposition of artificial borders that disregarded ethnic and cultural realities – disrupted natural state formations, divided families and fostered tensions that persist today. These borders continue to shape Cameroon’s socio-political landscape.\nThe Elung clan, for example, which remains divided along the Picot Line, is a painful reminder of how colonial partition disrupted communities.\nMuangwekan is one of 13 villages of the Elung clan. It sits on the eastern slopes of the Kupe Mwanenguba mountains, near the Picot Line. This coffee-growing village still bears remnants of colonial rule – most notably, a large concrete border marker once used to delineate British territory, perched on a hill overlooking the settlement.\nLife in Muangwekan carries on as usual, but its traditional ruler, Chief Atabe Emmanuel Ndonjume, is deeply concerned. A few years ago, a government commission proposed transferring Muangwekan to Melong Subdivision, part of the Moungo Division in the French-speaking Littoral region.\nThe proposal has prompted unrest, as Muangwekan has historically belonged to the Bangem administrative unit in the English-speaking region since Cameroon’s reunification in 1961.\n“This pillar was planted in 1947 by the British Commissioner in Buea. It shows that the next village [Ninong] is four miles away,” Chief Atabe said, tapping the concrete marker with his walking stick as villagers gathered around.\n“Muangwekan belonged to British Southern Cameroons at the time,” he continued. To him, those advocating for Muangwekan’s transfer to Melong Subdivision are mistaken.\nFor Chief Atabe and his people, the proposal is more than just a bureaucratic shift – it threatens the village’s historical identity and cultural heritage, a lingering consequence of colonial-era partitions that continue to shape Cameroon’s geopolitical landscape.\nDespite the controversy, Chief Atabe insists the colonial pillar should remain. “We shall uphold it because it serves as proof of where Muangwekan belongs and can help resolve any disputes over its administrative unit.”\nYet, artificial borders have not erased deep connections between Muangwekan and nearby Francophone villages like Mbuasum.\n“My father’s current wife is from Mbuasum. Many people here have brothers and uncles in Mbuasum,” he said, adding that people in some villages across the border are so closely related to him that marrying from there would be considered incest.\nReflecting on the past, he lamented the effect of colonial divisions: “The disappearance of the German administration caused us many problems. It was difficult to separate one people into two.”\nHis father, Atabe Francis, now 95, lived through the partition firsthand. He married across the former border and often travelled as far as Nkongsamba in former French Cameroon to sell tobacco.\n“There used to be peace,” the elderly man said, sitting frail in a wooden chair. “But these days, I am shocked by the tensions and divisions.”\nThe European-drawn borders that partitioned Africa more than a century ago continue to shape the continent’s challenges today.\n“The boundaries we have today were created by Europeans, and they have caused us a lot of problems,” said Cameroonian scholar, Joseph Takougang, a professor of African history at the University of Cincinnati.\n“If not for the second partition, Cameroon would have been one big, happy family,” he told Al Jazeera.\nWhen asked what Africa might have looked like if the Berlin Conference had never taken place, the specialist in colonial and post-colonial Africa, particularly Cameroonian nationalism and political developments, suggested the continent may have developed differently.\n“I don’t know. But I guess we wouldn’t have 55 different countries today. If you study pre-colonial Africa, you see that state formations were happening organically,” Takougang said, noting that kingdoms were expanding and institutions were evolving on the continent. “Africa would have created its own states, its own governance structures. But that process was disrupted by colonial partition.”\nSharing a personal anecdote from his time as a student at the University of Yaounde, he recalls a friend from Mamfe whose family had farms in Nigeria. “They would simply take a boat, cross the river, and go to their farms in Nigeria. It was that easy. The borders didn’t exist in their daily lives.”\nRegarding Cameroon’s current Anglophone-Francophone conflict, Takougang believes the only viable solution is a return to the pre-1972 federal system, which recognised West Cameroon (former British territory) and East Cameroon (former French territory) as federated states.\n“As long as one group of people is undermined and treated as second-class citizens, and no one is willing to listen to them, I don’t know what will happen. Until we have partners willing to sit down and genuinely discuss the issues, nothing will change.”\nOn the broader question of African unity, Takougang posits that the continent would have been more powerful in the event a “United States of Africa” was formed.\n“The more divided we are, the easier we are to exploit,” he said, adding that France directly benefits from instability in Cameroon, Togo, Benin, the Central African Republic, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. “They don’t want African nations to unite because then they wouldn’t be able to play one side against the other. That’s why they will never support true African independence.”\nFor the damage colonial powers have caused to Africa, Takougang supports the idea of reparations, but is sceptical about its implementation. “I subscribe to reparations, but in what form? Sending money will only end up in the hands of a corrupt few. Instead, we need technology transfer – something that can actually build African economies.”\nFor his part, Nkwi, the anthology professor, also argues that colonial powers enriched themselves at Africa’s expense, and as such should pay for reparations. “These countries discovered natural resources in Africa and exploited them – both the land and the people. Millions were taken to the Americas as slaves. Africa lost not just human resources but also natural wealth.”\nAcross the continent, ethnic and cultural divisions persist as a result of lines drawn arbitrarily on a map by foreigners who did not consult any Africans when carving up their territories.\nAs a way forward in bridging the divides in Cameroon, Nkwi acknowledged the issue is complex.\nHe noted that many Francophone Cameroonians historically migrated to English-speaking regions due to the oppressive nature of French colonial rule. “After the Berlin Conference, many Francophones – Douala people, Bulus, Bamilekes – moved to the English-speaking regions because they found French rule too harsh.”\nHowever, reintegrating these communities remains difficult. “The problem is that Francophones have developed a mentality of superiority, rooted in the French colonial philosophy of ‘mission civilisatrice’ [the civilising mission]. This has deepened the divide between the two cultures.\n“These divisions are cultural,” he said. “When people share a culture, it distinguishes them, and cultural values are difficult to erase.”\nWhile many worry that the road to unity remains elusive, Takougang and Nkwi both say that Cameroon’s future depends on genuine dialogue, political will, and an honest reckoning with its colonial past. Without these, the nation risks remaining trapped in a cycle of division and instability.\nFor elders Atabe and Tanjuh, the arrival and subsequent departure of colonial rulers disrupted established social structures and cultural practices, and it was difficult to adapt. However, they feel their communities have been resilient, transcending all imposed barriers.\nNow surrounded by their descendants, they remain hopeful in spite of the challenges – believing that communities once partitioned will reunite, restoring the harmony of pre-colonial times.\n“One day I will be gone,” Tanjuh said, sitting on the doorstep of her humble green and white house in Mudeka, “but I deeply long to see peace reign before I leave.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

        "headline": "The colonial partition that keeps Cameroon split along ‘artificial lines’",
        "body": "A century ago, Germany, France and Britain claimed the country at different times. The scars remain visible in conflicts today.\nTiko, Cameroon –On a warm day in Mudeka, an English-speaking village across the river from Cameroon’s Francophone region, supercentenarian Atemafac Anathasia Tanjuh pieces together snippets of her childhood memories.\nTanjuh, whose family says she is about 120 years old, is one of the last living witnesses to European colonial rule in Africa and her Bangwa people’s fierce resistance against German colonisation.\n“They imposed their rules on us,” Tanjuh said, surrounded by one of her five surviving children and some great-grandchildren, her voice laced with both nostalgia and resilience. After European powers split up Africa during the1884-1885 Berlin Conference, Cameroon became a German protectorate until after World War I (WWI), when it was carved up between Britain and France.\nTanjuh said her people endured harsh times under the Germans, but the true weight of imperial rule grew much heavier under the French and British – the remnants of which leave Cameroon deeply divided and at war today.\nWhen the English and French first partitioned the country in 1919, Tanjuh’s community found itself torn apart.\n“We could no longer move from Fontem [which was under British rule] to the market in Dschang [which was under French rule], where I used to go to sell cocoyam and palm kernel,” she said. The divisions severed ties with their historical trading partners and relatives on the other side.\nAs the years progressed, the divide became more than merely physical – also linguistic and cultural. After independence in the 1960s, Cameroon maintained its French-majority culture, while those in the Anglophone regions felt increasingly marginalised.\nThis escalated, eventually manifesting in a violent conflict between Anglophone armedseparatistsand Francophone state-armed troops, which has killed more than 6,500 and displaced about 700,000 people in the southwest and northwest of the country since late 2016.\nAt the sound of gunfire from the separatist clashes today, Tanjuh is drawn swiftly back to her memories of World War I, her daughter says. “Let’s hide in the caves to stay safe, just like we did back then,” the elder tells her family, her instincts sharp and honed by a lifetime of turmoil.\nBefore European colonisation, Cameroon was a rich tapestry of independent kingdoms, each with its own territory, leadership, culture and traditions. However, this intricate web of societies was upended in 1884 when Germany annexed the region, unifying it under a single colony named Kamerun. This move was cemented by the arbitrary partition of Africa at the Berlin Conference – an exclusive gathering of European powers and the United States, which concluded exactly 140 years ago this week.\nThe aftermath of World War I further reshaped Cameroon’s destiny. Germany’s defeat led to the colony being seized and divided in 1919 between Britain and France, this time in Versailles. The partition was drawn up by representatives of the two powers – who, notably, had little firsthand knowledge of the land or its people.\nThe Picot Line, named after French representative Georges Picot (who also negotiated theSykes-Picot Agreementthat split up the Ottoman Empire after WWI) and negotiated with British delegate Lancelot Oliphant, arbitrarily split Cameroonian communities that shared common ethnic, linguistic and cultural heritage. As a result, communities like the Mbo people, for example, speak English in the Kupe Muanenguba Division but French just across the Mungo River.\nPaul Nchoji Nkwi, a retired professor of African anthropology at the University of Yaounde I, highlights that before the Berlin Conference, there was no attempt to study Africa’s ethnographic composition so as to create meaningful borders.\n“They simply drew straight lines,” he said, pointing out that many Cameroonian ethnic groups, such as the Efik, have close relatives across the border in Nigeria. “If you look at most maps, especially in West Africa, the boundaries are straight, artificial lines. Yet, despite this, ethnic groups have remained culturally connected.”\nThe wave of liberation movements in the 1960s finally brought political independence. French Cameroon gained independence in 1960, followed by British Cameroon in 1961, leading to their reunification as a federal state. However, this process was fraught with challenges.\nThe colonial legacy – particularly the forced imposition of artificial borders that disregarded ethnic and cultural realities – disrupted natural state formations, divided families and fostered tensions that persist today. These borders continue to shape Cameroon’s socio-political landscape.\nThe Elung clan, for example, which remains divided along the Picot Line, is a painful reminder of how colonial partition disrupted communities.\nMuangwekan is one of 13 villages of the Elung clan. It sits on the eastern slopes of the Kupe Mwanenguba mountains, near the Picot Line. This coffee-growing village still bears remnants of colonial rule – most notably, a large concrete border marker once used to delineate British territory, perched on a hill overlooking the settlement.\nLife in Muangwekan carries on as usual, but its traditional ruler, Chief Atabe Emmanuel Ndonjume, is deeply concerned. A few years ago, a government commission proposed transferring Muangwekan to Melong Subdivision, part of the Moungo Division in the French-speaking Littoral region.\nThe proposal has prompted unrest, as Muangwekan has historically belonged to the Bangem administrative unit in the English-speaking region since Cameroon’s reunification in 1961.\n“This pillar was planted in 1947 by the British Commissioner in Buea. It shows that the next village [Ninong] is four miles away,” Chief Atabe said, tapping the concrete marker with his walking stick as villagers gathered around.\n“Muangwekan belonged to British Southern Cameroons at the time,” he continued.

        "headline": "Mystery disease kills more than 50 in DRC: What we know so far",
        "body": "Officials have ruled out Ebola or Marburg virus, but say those infected are presenting symptoms of a ‘hemorrhagic fever’.\nA mysterious viral disease has emerged in parts of western Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in recent weeks, resulting in at least 53 deaths, officials say.\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), clinicians are particularly concerned about the short period between the onset of what appear to be symptoms of a “hemorrhagic fever” and death – around just 48 hours – prompting fears that there could be a high number of deaths if the outbreak continues.\nThis is the latest viral epidemic to hit the East African region in the past year, following outbreaks of Marburg and mpox diseases among others.\nThe DRC, in particular, is susceptible to epidemics because of its tropical climate, in which pathogens thrive, as well as its dense forests which expose people to wildlife likely to carry diseases. Many viral diseases in the country, and elsewhere, have also been linked to consumption of the meat of wild animals.\nHere’s what we know about the latest viral threat:\nThe new virus was first detected in January, in a remote village called Boloko, in DRC’s Equateur Province. It occurred in three children who had eaten a dead bat, according to WHO. All three of the children, aged under five years old, died within 48 hours of presenting symptoms including fever, chills and headaches, between January 10 and 13.\nFour more deaths were recorded in the same village among children between the ages of five and 18, all with similar symptoms, in late January. One death, on January 22, was recorded in the nearby village of Danda.\nOn February 9, a second outbreak of the disease was recorded in Bomate, a separate town some distance away.\nBy February 15, 431 cases had been recorded with 53 deaths in total according to WHO (PDF), which said the fatality rate was 10.7 percent. About half of the deaths were recorded within 48 hours of the symptoms’ onset.\nAccording to the WHO, symptoms of the disease suggest it belongs to a group of diseases called viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHF), meaning they cause excessive sickness and blood loss. Recognised examples of such diseases include Ebola, Lassa fever and Marburg virus.\nSymptoms recorded so far of the unknown disease in the DRC include fever, chills, headache, body aches, sweating, runny nose, neck stiffness, cough, vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal cramps.\nAccording to WHO, it’s not clear exactly what the cause of the disease is, or how the virus is transmitted. No clear link between the two outbreak points has been established yet. In a report, WHO said the lack of an obvious connection between the two hotspots could “suggest two separate health events”.\nMajor concerns, according to WHO, are that a “severe infectious or toxic agent” – that is, a naturally occurring virus – could be involved, and that the disease so far presents with an “exceptionally high” fatality rate.\n“Key challenges [also] include the rapid progression of the disease, with nearly half of the deaths occurring within 48 hours of symptom onset in one of the affected health zones, and an exceptionally high case fatality rate in another,” WHO said.\nEarlier in February, the country’s National Institute for Biomedical Research in Kinshasa tested samples from 12 active cases, and from one deceased person. Test results have ruled out similar hemorrhagic diseases such as Ebola andMarburgvirus.\nTesting and contact tracing are continuing in affected locations by teams of local staff and WHO officials. However, the remoteness of the two hotspots, as well as limited lab capacity and generally weak healthcare infrastructure in the DRC could see the disease spread further, the WHO warned.\nMeanwhile, isolation rooms have been set up in some villages in the region, and health workers are going to communities to brief people about the new disease.\nSome health experts have said they suspect the viral disease could be zoonotic – a disease which spreads from animals to humans – because of the reports of children eating a bat, which are known to carry viruses which can be deadly for humans. In the past, viruses such as Ebola and Marburg have struck human beings who have eaten infected bats.\nUntil the new disease can be identified, it is difficult to know how easily humans will be able to fight it off, Dr Zania Stamataki, an associate professor in viral immunology at the University of Birmingham, told the UK’s Science Media Centre.\n“If the infection originated from a virus that came from a bat, this tells us that it is unlikely that we have pre-existing immunity to this new infection for humans, so we are unprotected [and] we suffer severe disease and even death,” Stamataki said.\n“[But] if the virus is similar to other viruses infecting humans – like the COVID-causing virus was similar to some common cold coronaviruses – some people may stand a chance to show less severe symptoms and recover,” she added.\nThe country is currently in the grips of an armed conflict in the Eastern Kivu Province led by therebel M23 group, which recently captured the key towns of Goma (January 27) and Bukavu (February 14).\nViolence there has already devastated the region’s healthcare infrastructure and has caused massive displacement in recent months. Hospitals are overwhelmed and aid workers have also been attacked.\nPresently,an mpox outbreakis also ongoing in the region. DRC health officials and the WHO expressed concern about the high rate of fatalities –4.9 percent– last June, as well as about a new, more infectious variant discovered in Kamituga, South Kivu Province, in August.\nBetween November 25 and January 5, more than 2,400 cases of the disease and five deaths were reported. Since the start of the outbreak, DRC had reported a total of 11,834 cases and 1,304 deaths by February 23, according to the Africa Center for Disease Control.\nRecentshipmentsof mpox vaccines from Western donors such as the United States, Japan and the European Union enabled officials to provide vaccines to at least 50,000 people by December. It’s unclear how many vaccines are needed to cover the country’s 105 million population.\nThe virus has also spread to neighbouring Burundi, Uganda, Rwanda, and Kenya, although in lower numbers.\nIn December, the WHO reported that a newly identified, severe case of malaria hadcaused 48 deathswithin three months in Panzi, southern Kwango Province. That outbreak is ongoing.\nMeanwhile,Ugandahas newly recorded cases of the Sudan virus (in the same family as the Ebola virus). Nine cases and one death have been confirmed since January 30.\nTanzania is facing an outbreak of Marburg virus, in the northwest Kagera District. Since January, 10 cases have been reported including two confirmed and eight probable cases. All have resulted in death.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

        "headline": "Andrew Tate and brother arrive in US after Romania travel ban lifted",
        "body": "Romanian prosecutors confirm travel ban lifted as court rules to lift seizure of multiple assets.\nRight-wing influencer brothers Andrew and Tristan Tate, who are under investigation in Romania on allegtions including human trafficking, have arrived in the United States after authorities lifted travel restrictions imposed on the pair as part of the case.\nThe brothers, who have dual United Kingdom and US citizenship, left Romania’s capital Bucharest on Thursday morning on board a private jet bound for Florida, as Romanian anti-organised crime agency DIICOT said it had approved “a request to modify” their travel ban.\nRomanian prosecutorsdetainedformer kickboxer Andrew Tate, 38, and his brother Tristan, 36, in 2022, accusing them of setting up a criminal organisation in Romania and the UK in 2021, human trafficking, trafficking of minors, sexual intercourse with a minor and money laundering. They deny all the allegations.\nDIICOT said in a statement that the Tates remained “under judicial supervision” and still had to respond to any summons from judicial authorities, with violations “in bad faith” liable to be punished with a “higher custodial measure”.\nA court in Bucharest also ruled in favour of an appeal by the Tates to lift the seizure of multiple assets, according to the brothers’ spokesperson, Mateea Petrescu.\nThe assets include six luxury vehicles, land and properties, and company shares. All previously frozen bank accounts have been unfrozen, she said.\n“While some assets remain under precautionary seizure, this ruling marks a significant step toward justice,” she said.\nThe Tates’ arrival in the US comes after Romania’s Foreign Minister Emil Hurezeanu said that the brothers were mentioned during his brief hallway meeting with US President Donald Trump’s special envoy Richard Grenell at the Munich Security Conference earlier this month.\nHe denied he had faced pressure to lift the travel ban on the Tates, after the Financial Times newspaper cited sources claiming that members of the Trump administration had pressed Bucharest to remove the restrictions.\nCristi Danilet, a former judge in Romania’s northern city of Cluj, said that any bilateral agreement on lifting the “preventative measure” would be unprecedented.\n“If it is true, it means that there is no more rule of law and sovereign countries,” he said.\n\n\n\nRomanian authorities formally indicted the Tates along with two Romanian women last year. All four deny the allegations.\nA first criminal case failed in December when the Bucharest court of appeals decided not to start the trial and sent the files back to prosecutors citing flaws in the indictment.\nIn April, another court, the Bucharest Tribunal, ruled that a trial could start but didn’t set a date.\nPending the completion of the ongoing criminal investigation, the Tates are under judicial control, a light preventative measure under which they are required to check in with the police at regular intervals.\nABritish arrest warranton allegations of sexual aggression between 2012 and 2015 has also been issued for the Tates, who were set to be extradited after Romanian trial proceedings.\nIn a joint statement on Thursday, the four British women who brought the allegations expressed “disbelief”, saying there was now “a major risk” that criminal proceedings in Romania would be halted and calling on the authorities to “take action … to ensure he faces justice in the UK”.\nA spokesperson for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s office declined to comment on the situation or whether the UK wanted to see Tate extradited to the UK.\nA self-described misogynist, social media influencer Tate has gained millions of fans by promoting an ultra-masculine lifestyle that critics say denigrates women.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

        "headline": "Jailed PKK leader tells group to lay down arms, end conflict with Turkiye",
        "body": "In a historic move, Abdullah Ocalan has asked his party to ‘lay down arms’ and dissolve itself, according to a statement.\nThe jailed leader of Turkiye’s outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) Abdullah Ocalan has made a historic call for the party to lay down its arms, dissolve itself and end its decades-long conflict with the Turkish state.\nA delegation of Turkiye’s pro-Kurdish DEM Party on Thursday visited the island prison where Ocalan has been held since 1999 and later delivered his statement in nearby Istanbul.\n“I am making a call for the laying down of arms, and I take on the historical responsibility of this call,” Ocalan said in the letter.\n“Convene your [party] congress and make a decision. All groups must lay down their arms and the PKK must dissolve itself,” Ocalan said, according to the statement.\nThe PKK is deemed a “terrorist” organisation by Turkiye and its Western allies.\nCommenting on the move, ruling AK Party Deputy Chairman Efkan Ala said that his country will be “free of its shackles” if the PKK lays down arms and dissolves.\nIn the first response from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s ruling party, Ala said the government expected the PKK to comply with Ocalan’s call.\nAl Jazeera’s Sinem Koseoglu, reporting from Istanbul, said Ocalan’s letter carries “historical importance” as it is the first time he is asking the PKK to dissolve itself.\nThis makes the DEM Party “more significant in Turkish politics”, Koseoglu said.\n\n\n\nIn his letter, Ocalan explained his decision by saying that the PKK had been formed during a period where the Turkish state restricted Kurdish rights, but that Kurdish identity was no longer denied in Turkiye, and there had been “improvements in freedom of expression”.\nTurkiye has in recent decades removed restrictions on the use of the Kurdish language and the free expression of Turkish identity, particularly since the AK Party came to power in 2002. However, detractors say that the state has not gone far enough in granting more rights for Kurds in Turkiye.\n“Respect for identities, free self-expression, democratic self-organisation of each segment of society based on their own socio-economic and political structures, are only possible through the existence of a democratic society and political space,” Ocalan said in his letter.\nThe PKK launched its fight against the Turkish state in 1984. Its aim was an independent homeland for Kurds in southeastern Turkiye, but has since officially moved away from separatist goals, instead calling for more autonomy. However, it did not renounce armed violence, and groups affiliated with the PKK have continued to carry out sporadic attacks in Turkiye.\nIn October,the PKK claimed responsibility for an attackon a Turkish state-run defence company near Ankara, that killed five people and wounded 22 others. In response, Turkiye struck PKK targets in Iraq and Syria.\nTurkiye regularly conducts air attacks against the PKK in Iraq and against affiliated groups in Syria.\nThe appeal from Ocalan could have implications for the major oil-exporting region of northern Iraq, where the PKK is based, and for neighbouring Syria, which is emerging after 13 years of civil war and the ouster in December of President Bashar Al-Assad.\nThe president of the Kurdistan Regional Government in northern Iraq, Nechirvan Barzani, welcomed Ocalan’s message, while in Syria, Mazloum Abdi, the head of the Syrian Democratic Forces – many of whose leadership is affiliated with the PKK – said that Ocalan’s statement was “historic”, but was “not related to us in Syria”.\nA Turkiye-PKK peace process collapsed a decade ago.\nOcalan, 75, has been imprisoned on the island of Imrali, off Istanbul, since 1999 after being convicted of treason. Despite his incarceration, he continues to wield significant influence over the PKK and the group’s leadership is widely expected to heed any of his calls.\nOcalan’s momentous announcement is part of a new effort for peace between the group and the Turkish state, which was initiated in October by President Erdogan’s coalition partner, Devlet Bahceli. The nationalist politician suggested that Ocalan could be granted parole if his group renounces violence and disbands.\nLast year, Ocalan said he could shift the Kurdish question “from an arena of conflict and violence to one of law and politics”, later offering assurances he was “ready to take the necessary steps and make the call”.\nThursday’s meeting was the third time DEM Party officials have met with Ocalan as part of the peace efforts. The officials have also met with Selahattin Demirtas, an imprisoned former leader of the DEM Party’s predecessor, and travelled to Iraq for talks with Kurdish leaders there.\nThe DEM Party has had to change its name after it was repeatedly banned. Opponents say the party supports “PKK terrorism”, but DEM says it is calling for greater democracy in Turkiye, and say the shutdown of DEM’s predecessors and the imprisonment of Demirtas is evidence of a crackdown against Turkiye’s pro-Kurdish movement.\nGalip Dalay, senior consulting fellow at Chatham House, says if successful, the move would be one of the “most transformative events that have happened in the Middle East”.\nIt could “redefine the course of Turkish politics” and would also “redefine Turkiye’s relationship with the region’s Kurds in the main neighbouring states”, Dalay told Al Jazeera.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

        "body": "For most countries, the first day of fasting is likely to be March 2, depending on the sighting of the new moon.\nThe first day of fasting for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan in Mecca will be Saturday, March 1, or Sunday, March 2, depending on the sighting of the new moon. Other countries, especially in the Western Hemisphere, could see the Ramadan moon before Mecca this time.\nRamadan is determined by the Islamic lunar calendar, which begins with thesightingof the crescent moon. Saudi Arabia and other Muslim-majority countries rely on the testimonies of moon sighters to determine the start of the month.\nFor the moon to be visible, the crescent must set after the sun. This allows the sky to be dark enough to spot the small sliver of the new moon.\nAfter the sun sets on the night of February 28, the 29th day of Shaaban month in the Hijri calendar,moon sightersface west with a clear view of the horizon for a first glimpse of the crescent moon.\nIf the moon is sighted, the month of Ramadan begins, with the first fasting day being March 1. Otherwise, Shaaban will complete 30 days, and the first fasting day will be March 2.\nIn Saudi Arabia, testimonies of people who have spotted the moon are recorded, and the Supreme Court makes a decision on when Ramadan should begin.\n\nAccording to Crescent Moon Watch (PDF), a moon tracker run by the United Kingdom’s Nautical Almanac Office, Ramadan’s new moon will begin on February 28 at 3:45am Mecca time (00:45 GMT).\nOn February 28, the new moon should be visible only in the Pacific, North America and parts of South America.\nIt is unlikely that most of the world, including the Middle East, Europe, and South Asia, will be able to see the new crescent even with an optical aid.\nThe new moon will most likely be seen without optical aid if the skies are clear across most of the world on March 1.\nFor most countries in the Global South, the first day of fasting will most likely be March 2.\n\n\nLunar months last between 29 and 30 days, depending on the sighting of the new moon on the 29th night of each month. If the new moon is not visible, the month lasts 30 days.\n\nMuslims believe that Ramadan is the month when the first verses of theQuranwere revealed to the Prophet Muhammad more than 1,400 years ago.\nThroughout the month, observing Muslims fast from just before the sunrise prayer, Fajr, to the sunset prayer, Maghrib.\nThe fast entails abstinence from eating, drinking, smoking, and sexual relations to achieve greater “taqwa”, or consciousness of God.\nFasting is one of the five pillars of Islam, along with the Muslim declaration of faith, daily prayers, charity, and performing the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca if physically and financially capable.\nIn many Muslim-majority countries, working hours are reduced, and most restaurants are closed during the fasting hours.\n\nVarious Muslim-majority nations have a personalised greeting in their native languages. “Ramadan Mubarak” and “Ramadan Kareem” are common greetings exchanged over the month, wishing the recipient a blessed and generous month, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

        "headline": "US, EU move apart as Trump eyes Ukraine’s minerals and a deal with Russia",
        "body": "Two United Nations votes find the US siding with Russia against Europe, as Ukraine’s Zelenskyy prepares to sign a US deal on mineral wealth.\nZelenskyy to sign US mineral deal amid security uncertainty\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he plans to meet US President Donald Trump “as early as this Friday” to sign a bilateral commercial agreement to jointly develop and manage Ukraine’s mineral wealth.\nTrump insisted on the deal three weeks after assuming office in return for the assistance the US has provided in the three years since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, telling an interviewer, “I told [Ukraine] that I want the equivalent of, like, $500bn worth of rare earth, and they’ve essentially agreed to do that.”\nZelenskyy publicly rejected that figure, and hetwice rejectedany deal that did not contain security guarantees for Ukraine.\nA text of the agreement published by Western media on Wednesday did not reveal any guarantees, and placed no upper limit on the value the United States would receive – though Trump told reporters “it could be a trillion-dollar deal.”\nThe leaked agreement says Ukraine and the US would establish a joint fund, and Ukraine would “contribute to the Fund 50 percent of all revenues earned from the future monetisation of all relevant Ukrainian Government-owned natural resource assets … defined as deposits of minerals, hydrocarbons, oil, natural gas, and other extractable materials.”\nIt also included the revenues generated by infrastructure such as fossil gas terminals and ports.\nThe revenues of this fund would be reinvested “to promote the safety, security and prosperity of Ukraine”, it said.\nAjoint report this weekfrom the European Commission, World Bank, United Nations and Ukrainian government put the country’s reconstruction cost at well over half a trillion dollars.\nThe minerals agreement also did not address where that left European Union members, who have provided more than half the military and financial aid Ukraine has received, other than to say Ukraine and the US “will strive to avoid conflicts with Ukraine’s obligations under its accession to the European Union”.\nFrench Defence Minister Sebastien Lecornu revealed that he has been in talks with Ukraine since October to secure access to rare minerals vital to the defence and electronics industries.\n“Our defence industry will need a number of very key raw materials in our own weapons systems, not for next year, but for the next 30 or 40 years. We have to diversify that,” he said in a televised interview.\nOn the day the agreement was leaked, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk wrote on social media, “Uncertainty, unpredictability, deals. Are these really the rules that the new international order should be based on?”\nTrump has made no secret of his adversarial view of the EU. “The European Union was formed to screw the United States. That’s the purpose of it and they’ve done a very good job,” he told reporters at the start of his first cabinet meeting on February 26.\nTusk reacted by posting, “The EU wasn’t formed to screw anyone. Quite the opposite. It was formed to maintain peace, to build respect among our nations, to create free and fair trade.”\nTrump’s departure from a common position with Europe on Ukraine had become apparent when he started direct talks with Russia on February 18 that didn’t include Ukraine or the EU. A second round of those talks was to take place in Istanbul on Thursday.\nAs the war hit its third anniversary on Monday, Trump moved further away, siding with Russia in a UN Security Council vote that avoided naming Russia the aggressor in the war, or demanding the return of Ukrainian lands Russia has seized.\nEU members on the Security Council – including Britain, France, Greece, Slovenia and Denmark – abstained.\nThe US attempted to pass the same text in aUN General Assembly (UNGA) voteearlier in the day, but was rejected. The resolution the UNGA did pass also avoided naming Russia the aggressor in the war, but called for the restoration of Ukraine’s territorial integrity, in accordance with the UN Charter.\nIn 2023, Ukraine hadembarked on an effortto pass a UNGA resolution condemning Russia as an aggressor. Monday’s resolution, passed by 93 out of 193 countries, showed how far Ukraine is from garnering the two-thirds majority it seeks.\n“The system once based on rules, agreements, and shared values has been under a tsunami of geopolitical and geo-economic challenges … Now, its whole existence is under question,” wrote Victoria Vdovychenko, a programme leader at the University of Cambridge’s Centre for Geopolitics, in an article marking the war anniversary.\nIn a sign of Trump’s power, Europeans have tried to appease him despite the growing distance between them.\nThe day after the UN votes, French PresidentEmmanuel Macronheld a jovial press conference with Trump in the White House, where he offered cautious support for the minerals deal.\nHe also agreed that European countries “need to do more … to more fairly share the security burden that your country has been carrying for so many years”.\nPete Hegseth, Trump’s defence secretary, flatly stated on February 12 that “stark strategic realities prevent the United States of America from being primarily focused on the security of Europe,” and called on Europeans to spend 5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) on defence.\nBritish Prime MininsterKeirStarmer becamethe second EU leader to oblige Trump by announcing a hike in defence spending ahead of a trip to Washington on Thursday. Defence spending in the UK would go from 2 to 2.5 percent of GDP by 2027, and 3 percent by 2029, he said.\nHegseth told Europeans they would have to provide the “overwhelming share” of aid to Ukraine.\nThat was underlined this week, as Trump said he would not undertake the lion’s share of security guarantees.\nTrump told reportershe wasn’t going to oblige.\n“I’m not going to make security guarantees beyond very much,” he said on Wednesday. “We’re going to have Europe do that.”\nThat appeared to dampen the hopes Zelenskyy expressed after Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine, General Keith Kellogg, visited him in Kyiv on February 20. Zelenskyy said they had had a “good conversation” with “a lot of details” on security guarantees, among other things.\nOn SundayZelenskyy even offeredTrump his resignation after Trump called him a dictator.\n“If it’s about peace in Ukraine and you really want me to leave my position, I am ready to do that,” he told reporters. “Secondly, I can exchange it for NATO [membership] if there is such an opportunity.”\nEarlier in the day, Russia had unleashed its largest air attack of the war against Ukrainian cities, involving 267 Shahed kamikaze drones and three ballistic missiles. Ukraine shot down or used electronic jamming to disorient all but seven of the drones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

        "headline": "Canada already is America’s 51st state",
        "body": "And that is thanks to a political elite that did not heed prescient warnings.\nFor many Canadians, a thrilling ice hockey game turned out to be an exhilarating antidote to an unforgiving winter.\nMore than that – as a subdued Canadian coach Jon Cooper told reporters after Canada’s best hockey players beat America’s best hockey players in overtime last week – the beleaguered country “needed a win”.\n\n\n\n\nCooper wasn’t asked nor did he elaborate on why Canada had to prevail.\nHe didn’t have to.\nThe reasons were plain to the millions of Canadians who leapt, I reckon, with a mixture of joy and relief when the world’s most gifted hockey player, Connor McDavid, potted the goal that sent his team and a grateful nation into a happy frenzy.\nFor weeks, a blustering US President Donald Trump has taunted Canada and its prime minister. He has referred to a proud people and land as America’s would-be 51st state and Justin Trudeau as its “governor”.\nTrump’s antics and threats have triggered a surge of pride among usually reserved Canadians about their beloved home and worry for its uncertain future.\nAnd the trash-talking leader of Canada’s “dearest” and “closest” ally has proven that most politicians and corporate-hugging columnists have the foresight of Mr Magoo.\nLike the doddering, shortsighted, cartoon character, a host of free-trade-adoring politicos and polemicists refused to see or heed the warnings sounded in the 20th century about the existential risks of tying Canada more tightly into the dominant US economy in the 21st century.\nIt is a remarkable sight to watch, hear, and read Canada’s myopic “intelligentsia” drape themselves in the Maple Leaf while urging the country to “buy Canadian” and fashion other systemic and structural ways to try, belatedly, to curb its dependency on the United States to stave off becoming – officially – America’s 51st state.\nIt is a remarkable sight because, since the early 1980s, the reactionary elites have devoted – without hesitation or regret – their considerable powers and influence to backing every calculated step towards Canada morphing, in effect, into America’s 51st state – economically, culturally, militarily, and diplomatically.\nThe beaming poster boy for this blatant hypocrisy is Ontario’s premier, Doug Ford, who, by conviction and temperament, was all for Donald Trump before he was against him.\nIn a rare moment of sincerity, Ford – the pretend “populist” anointed “Captain Canada” by a gullible and easily impressed establishment press – admitted that he had wanted the havoc-wreaking Trump to return to the White House.\nA crystal ball wasn’t necessary to picture that, given the right conditions, a resource-hungry commander-in-chief with hegemonic aspirations would eventually occupy the Oval Office and attract like-minded acolytes in Canada.\nIn the early 1980s, I was a lowly undergraduate political science student, studying at the University of Toronto.\nOne of my professors was the late and renowned Canadian political economist, Stephen Clarkson.\nProfessor Clarkson was a brilliant teacher and thinker who thought and wrote a lot about Canada’s past, present, and the turbulent waters the country was heading into at that pivotal time.\nI was among the lucky stable of Clarkson’s research assistants when he embarked on writing a book about the perils that the brewing prospects of a free trade deal between Ottawa and Washington – championed by US President Ronald Reagan – posed to Canada’s sovereignty.\nThe book published in 1982 and titled, Canada and the Reagan Challenge, was, at once, a sober rebuttal to the legion of giddy continentalists who were convinced that Canada should deepen its already inexorable links to the United States, as well as a flare that raised the alarm about the country’s fast waning ability to exert any tangible measure of independence at home and abroad.\nWhile Clarkson was a nationalist, he was also a realist. He knew that, by virtue of geography and history, Canada and America were bound to one another.\nStill, he understood the urgent imperative for Canada to look beyond the immediate horizon to broaden trade in existing and emerging markets outside the United States as a means to diversify its export and import policies and, as a result, reduce America’s gravitational pull.\nClarkson’s prescient cautions were dismissed by a smug gallery of “free-trade” apostles as the anachronistic, anti-American “spleen bursts” of an academically trained ostrich opposed to prosperity.\nSo, when Prime Minister Brian Mulroney negotiated a comprehensive free-trade deal with Reagan in 1988 – much of Parliament and the press trumpeted the agreement as a victory of commerce over silly, outdated notions of Canadian autonomy.\nThe 1988 federal election was fought over the potential consequences for Canada of the Mulroney-Reagan pact.\nIn a televised debate, then Liberal leader, John Turner, famously challenged Mulroney – who claimed, absurdly, that the deal could be “cancelled” at any time.\n“With one signature of a pen,” Turner thundered, “you’ve … thrown us into the north-south influence of the United States and will reduce us, I am sure, to a colony of the United States because political independence is sure to follow.”\nTurner’s chest-thumping performance was just that – a performance. The Liberal Party’s opposition to the Mulroney-brokered free-trade accord was a rhetorical pantomime.\nSoon enough, Liberal prime ministers were singing their own fulsome praises of the deal and inviting Mexico to join the continent-wide arrangement consecrated by the smiling, hand-holding “Three Amigos”.\nFast forward to February 2025 and Professor Clarkson’s admonitions and reservations from more than four decades ago have come to fruition.\nAn emboldened US president appears intent on annexing Canada by economic coercion and, given the policy of almost unfettered integration pursued by a succession of Liberal and Conservative governments – and endorsed by starry-eyed editorial writers – Trump has the levers and leverage to do it.\nSuddenly, Clarkson’s critics – inside and outside amnesiac newsrooms and capital cities – are rushing to adopt his “silly, outdated” prescriptions to preserve the nation’s phantom sovereignty and outdo one another as standing on guard for thee – Canada, that is.\nTheir epiphanies are 40 years too late.\nCanada has, by their deliberate design, long been America’s eager, “open for business” vassal.\nThe views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

        "headline": "It’s regular old racism, not ‘Hinduphobia’",
        "body": "Trump’s return to power exposed an underbelly of anti-Indian racism in the MAGA-verse. Hindi nationalists who support him are working hard to conceal the truth.\nIt’s been an awkward few months for Hindu nationalists who have been eagerly awaiting Trump’s return to the White House.\nThere have been a few wins.\n\n\n\n\nStrategic and defence ties betweenIndia and the USseem stable for now, following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the White House. Modi claimed that like Trump’s quest to “Make America Great Again” (MAGA), he too strived to “Make India Great Again” (MIGA). He added, “When America and India work together, when it’s MAGA plus MIGA, it becomes mega – a mega partnership for prosperity.”\nKash Patel has been confirmed to lead the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Born to Gujarati parents, he has been vocal about his Hindu identity and even voiced support for theconstruction of the Ram Mandirin Ayodhya in 2024, on the ruins of a 16th-century mosque demolished by a Hindu nationalist mob back in 1992.\nYet Trump’s return has also exposed an underbelly of anti-Indian racism in the MAGA-verse.\nIn late December, an apparent “civil war” broke out in the MAGA-verse and Indian Americans were at the centre of it. The trigger was Donald Trump’s appointment of Indian American venture capitalist Sriram Krishnan as senior policy adviser to the White House for Artificial Intelligence (AI). Krishnan’s appointment coincided with MAGA debates over the H1B visa scheme that brings skilled foreign workers to the US. Many in Trump’s camp have long insisted that its beneficiaries – mostly Indians – undercut the American workforce.\nMany Trump loyalists, like “far-right provocateur” Laura Loomer, were outraged at the appointment. Loomer posted on X: “It’s alarming to see the number of career leftists who are now being appointed to serve in Trump’s admin when they share views that are in direct opposition to Trump’s America First agenda.”\nA MAGA fan posted on X that people like Krishnan view “Western nations as economic zones and nothing more” and have “no business holding positions of power in the American government”. Another agreed and urged President Trump and Vice President Vance to instead “interview American-born Tech Workers and get their opinion!”\nMore recently, a staff member of Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Marko Elez, was forced to resign when he was linked to racist social media posts. One of his posts read, “Normalize Indian hate”. Yet, Vice President JD Vance, whose wife and mother of his children is a daughter of Indian immigrants, called for him to be hired back. He said that while he disagreed with Elez’s posts, he didn’t think that “stupid social media activity should ruin a kid’s life”. President Trump agreed with his vice president and Elez was rehired.\nAll of this is not surprising.\nRacism and xenophobia have been a central pillar of Trump’s “America First” policy. His targets have been undocumented migrants arriving from America’s southern borders; refugees and migrants from Muslim-majority countries like Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen; and immigrants from what he termed as “s***hole countries” in Africa and from Haiti and El Salvador entering the US through the “visa lottery system”. Why can’t the US “have more immigrants from Norway”? Trump wondered.\nSo, it’s hardly out of order that MAGA loyalists – who have been promised a draconian crackdown on immigration in Trump’s second term – seem to be uncomfortable with a foreign-born, brown-skinned executive, who has advocated for raising country caps on green cards, in the White House. After all, in their eyes, Krishnan epitomises the old trope of the insidious foreigner taking jobs that belong to honest, hardworking Americans.\nBut rather than calling it racism, Hindu groups are crying “Hinduphobia”! Why?\nIn part, it’s because Trump’s racism and xenophobia are what Hindu groups have long endorsed. In general, they view Trump as “good for business” when it comes to Hindu nationalist politics.\nTrump and Modi have indeed nurtured a longstanding bromance. But Hindu groups’ endorsement of Trump is not just about this affinity between the two leaders. It’s about values.\nTrump’s disdain for DEI policies and affirmative action jibes well with Hindu nationalists’disdainfor any liberal talk of anti-Caste discrimination, affirmative action or legislation protecting the rights of marginalised communities, be it at home in India or the diaspora. The MAGA brand of Islamophobia is also one that Hindu nationalists can get behind. After all, violence and discrimination against India’s Muslims have been a marquee feature of the Modi-led Hindu nationalist brand of governance.\nSimilarly, Trump’s xenophobia wasn’t seen as incompatible with Hindu nationalist talking points. For them, the demonisation of undocumented migrants or the securitisation of Muslim immigrants only reinforced the characterisation of Indian Hindus in the US as the “model migrant” who contribute positively to the US economy and society.\nBut this turning of the tide against the model Indian immigrant was not something they had planned for. They had endorsed Trump’s racism and xenophobia, hoping it would conveniently spare them as the exception.\nSo, unable to call it racism – lest this exposes the hypocrisy of their endorsement of Trump – Hindu groups are crying “Hinduphobia”.\nThe politics surrounding the charge of “Hinduphobia” in this context are highly problematic.\nViolence and discrimination are indeed a reality for Hindus in many places in the world. However, arguing that the attacks on Krishnan and the MAGA-verse’s outrage over the H1B visa scheme is an outgrowth of systemic discrimination against Hindus is inaccurate.\nIn fact, a recent study by the Center for the Study of Organized Hate reveals that while social media platforms like X were indeed rife with “anti-Indian hatred against Indians and Indian-Americans”, these attacks were “not exclusively aimed at Hindus”. Rather, they targeted “everyone perceived to be of Indian origin” which includes Sikhs. More generally, according to the FBI’s hate crime statistics, Hindus are one of the least targeted religious groups in the country.\nNonetheless, the charge of “Hinduphobia” – one that has been “popularised among Hindu nationalist groups in the United States” – serves a political agenda in two ways.\nFor one thing, it feeds into the longstanding Hindu nationalist claim that Indian-ness is synonymous with Hinduism. This argument purposefully overlooks the diversity of religious and ethnic identities that make up the sociocultural fabric of India.\nIt also falsely paints Hindus as a systemically marginalised group – a claim that is then weaponised against academics and activists who criticise Hindu nationalist politics, often leading to death and rape threats against such individuals and their families. It is also used to evade and delegitimize any criticism of caste discrimination in India or the diaspora and Hindu nationalist hate speech and violence against Indian Muslims and Christians.\nUnfortunately, the vocabulary of “Hinduphobia” is not just a talk-point of Hindu nationalist groups. It may soon become legislation. Congressman Shri Thanedar introduced a resolution in April 2024 that celebrates Hindu contributions to the US and condemns “Hinduphobia, and anti-Hindu bigotry”. A year before that the Georgia Assembly also passed a resolution condemning Hinduphobia.\nUnder Trump 2.0, racism, bigotry and discrimination will be an incessant feature of everyday life and politics. And false claims of “Hinduphobia” only distract us from the real suffering of the country’s marginalised communities.\nThe views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

        "body": "\"I know great grief is born only of great love,\" Kylie Jenner wrote in a heartfelt tribute to the late artist.\nByRania Aniftos\nJesus Guerrero, a beloved celebrity hairstylist who has worked with a slew of high-profile clients including Kylie Jenner, Jennifer Lopez, ROSÉ, Rosalía, Katy Perry, Camila Cabello, Charli xcx and many more, died over the weekend at age 34.\nSee latest videos, charts and news\nSee latest videos, charts and news\n\nWhile no cause of death has been revealed, his family noted on aGoFundMepage that he died “very suddenly and unexpectedly.” The fundraiser has earned more than $96,000 for the costs of bringing his body home to Houston, Texas, as well as funeral costs — though Guerrero’s younger sister later revealed that Jenner has offered to cover the funeral. “Donations raised through this fundraiser will go toward the costs associated with securing his belongings home. As well as other unexpected expenses to settle his assets,” the GoFundMe now reads.\n\nFollowing the devastating news, a number of stars took to social media to mourn the loss of a friend and fellow creative. “The sweetest angel when I needed one the most,” ROSÉ wrote on herInstagram Stories. “I love you so much.. and i miss you already. Rest in power. You will always be remembered for your incredible work.”\n\nLopez, who was with Guerrero just a few days prior to his death in Dubai, also shared a touching tribute alongside a black-and-white photo of the artist. “It’s no surprise your mother gave you the name Jesus. You were gentle and kind and loving, quiet and unassuming, but so powerful, and your presence was felt the minute you walked into any room,” she wrote. “You never demanded the spotlight. You never needed to make a sound to be recognized, your heart and your talent did that as effortlessly as you artistry did. I’ve been having trouble putting the words together the last few days.”\nShe continued, “The truth is I’m still in shock that such a beautiful young life has come to an end. It seems senseless and unfair. I know your family is brokenhearted as am I and everyone else who knew you. Your spirit moved on to the next phase beyond this life but I know wherever you are there is beauty and light. And the beauty and light you left here will live on forever. Rest in peace, sweet angel…”\nSee her posthere.\nJenner wrote a similarly heartfelt post about Guerrero on her page, along with several photos of the duo smiling and working together. “Jesus was more than my friend – he was a light in my life, a source of laughter, comfort, love, and unwavering support. I don’t know how I would have made it through the last almost decade without him by my side. He had a way of making even the heaviest days feel lighter,” she wrote.\n\n“Thank you, Jesus, for always being there for me, for lifting me up, for being my friend,” Jenner added. “The pain of losing you is just unbearable and i don’t know how to move forward without you but I know great grief is born only of great love. and I loved you so much. You were the best person, with a talent that was unmatched. a true artist. You inspired so many, and you always will.”\nSee her posthere.\nGet weekly rundowns straight to your inbox\nA daily briefing on what matters in the music industry\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form.\nA daily briefing on what matters in the music industry\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form.\nBillboard is a part of Penske Media Corporation. © 2025 Billboard Media, LLC.

W. Norton and Allen Lane/Penguin Press, the book is authored by McCartney and edited by historian Ted Widmer, featuring an in-depth personal account of the band, as told by McCartney, key players, and family members.\nWings was formed in 1971 by McCartney following the dissolution of The Beatles the previous year, the release of his self-titled debut album one week later, and the arrival of 1971’sRamalbum with wifeLinda. Recruiting Moody Blues co-founder Denny Laine and drummer Denny Seiwell, the band would continue until 1981, releasing a total of seven studio albums, including four consecutive records that topped the Billboard 200.\nSee latest videos, charts and news\nSee latest videos, charts and news\n\n“I’m so very happy to be transported back to the time that was Wings and relive some of our madcap adventures through this book,” said McCartney in a statement. “Starting from scratch after The Beatles felt crazy at times. There were some very difficult moments and I often questioned my decision. But as we got better I thought, ‘OK this is really good.’\n\n“We proved Wings could be a really good band. To play to huge audiences in the same way The Beatles had and have an impact in a different way.

        "headline": "Keropons Talk Helping Families Through Music, Balancing Work & Parenting: Billboard Japan Women in Music Interview",
        "body": "The duo spoke with Billboard Japan about creating an environment that makes it easier for women to work.\nByBillboard Japan\nBillboard Japan’s Women in Music initiative launched in 2022 to celebrate artists, producers and executives who have made significant contributions to music and inspired other women through their work, in the same spirit as Billboard’s annual Women in Music honors since 2007. This interview series featuring female players in the Japanese entertainment industry is one of the highlights ofJapan’s WIM project.\nSee latest videos, charts and news\nSee latest videos, charts and news\n\nKeropons, the duo consisting of Yuko Masuda (Kero) and Akiko Hirata (Pon), are the next featured guests. Probably known best for their kids’ tune “Ebikanics,” Keropons is hugely popular with children and parents in Japan. The duo’s catchy melodies and lyrics, impossible to forget once you’ve heard them, have provided fun times for many families over the years.\n\nThe unit was also tapped as the first act for the KIDS MUSIC PARK music project launched by Universal Music Japan in collaboration with major Japanese publisher Kodansha. The two women spoke with writer Rio Hirai on behalf of Billboard Japan for the latest installment of the WIM interview series and shared their views on creating an environment that makes it easier for women to work, based on their experience interacting with parents and children all over Japan throughout their careers.\n\nYou two were chosen as the first act for the music project KIDS MUSIC PARK, a collaboration between Universal Music and Kodansha’s online media “with class mama.” You wrote a new song called “Chu-zaburo” based on the honest voices of moms and dads all over the country for this project. How did you feel when you were asked to take part in it?\nAkiko Hirata (Pon): We were so happy. It was exciting because there were parts that were similar to the family concerts we’d been doing up until now, and the person at Universal Music who started the project is also a mom raising kids, which I thought was great. The project was a new endeavor in that we spoke directly with mom influencers and wrote the song with them after hearing what they had to say.\nThere must be many moms out there who have been helped by your music. Have you ever discovered something new or had fresh insights from the feedback and comments from your listeners?\nYuko Masuda (Kero): Yes, a lot. This time, Pon wrote the lyrics first, and then we worked on the music. We asked the moms to listen to the lyrics and when we asked how their kids react to music, one of them said, “My child laughs when I shake my hips!” Other moms followed suit, like, “Mine does, too!” so we went, “Well then, let’s shake our hips in this song.” That’s what the production process was like. A mother who was facing difficulties raising her child mentioned that she felt too self-conscious to give hugs or kisses, so we incorporated hugs and blowing kisses into the choreography. Everyone can do these naturally when they’re part of a song. It’s interesting how people gradually get used to it as they do it while laughing.\n\nYou’ve also performed it live after it was released digitally in December. How was the reaction to it?\nPon: It’s been really fun. I was wondering if people would hug, but everyone seems to enjoy it more than I expected. The kids hug each other, of course, and parents hug their kids, and also adults at training sessions for nursery school teachers did it, too. Everyone gets all excited when the hugging part comes.\nYou’re also a mother of two kids, Pon. How have you managed to balance work and parenting?\nPon: I had twins and went back to work four months after they were born. At first, I was really keen to do everything myself without relying on anyone else, but in reality, all sorts of unexpected things kept happening.\nWhat happened?\nPon: First of all, I got sick soon after becoming pregnant and was bedridden for almost a year. I’d actually planned on working right before my due date, but suddenly wasn’t able to work at all. Our work schedule is decided a year in advance. We had a packed schedule of concerts lined up but I couldn’t move, so I ended up having to rely on a lot of people for help.\nI told everyone around me that I wouldn’t trouble anyone but ended up inconveniencing my company, and wasn’t sure if I’d be able to raise my kids properly. Becoming a mom was supposed to be a happy occasion, but my worries became bigger than the joy and I just kept crying in bed.\nHow did you manage to lift your spirits from there?\nPon: I thought, “I can’t take any more time off,” and resumed work four months after my kids were born. We moved to Nagano later on, but raising twins was hard. Even though I sought help from my mother, my ex-husband, my neighbors, and anyone else I could think of, it still wasn’t enough. In the end, I used the Family Support Center run by the local government. It’s a system where registered people in the community look after people’s kids.\n\nBut my job often required me to stay overnight and I had to go work almost every weekend, and this system didn’t cover overnight care. I was at a complete loss when one of the support staff said to me, “It’s not allowed under the current system, but I know you need assistance,” called a few people to help, and they started providing overnight care.\nYou started your activities in 2004, and I imagine you still have many opportunities to speak with moms and dads. Do you sense any changes in society or the times?\nPon: Yes, I do. There are more young female artists, singers like us, who are also working while raising children. I think it’s easier now for people like them to say, “I’m going to take a break to have a baby, but I’ll be back,” and everyone accepts that. That atmosphere is different from what it used to be like.\nIt might still be like the old days in some ways, but it has changed a lot.\nPon: That’s so true. Now, taking maternity leave has become the norm, and the pandemic led to a trend of people being encouraged to take it easy and rest, which is also a big change. In the past, as a duo, we worried that if one of us took time off, the work wouldn’t get done. But now we have more young people working in our field and the way of thinking in society as a whole is becoming more flexible, which is great.\nHave you ever felt that being a woman has impacted your career, not just in terms of motherhood?\nKero: I’ve come this far without really having to be aware of being a woman, and never faced any major obstacles in that sense. There are lots of women in music colleges, and also a lot of women in the field of childcare.\nPon: Shortly after having kids, a man in the same industry said to me, “It must be hard for you to work in this kind of job when you have a baby.” I was surprised by his tone, which was like, “It’s not my problem because I’m a man.” It makes me feel uncomfortable when people talk about childcare like it’s something only women do. I was too taken aback to respond at the time, but I told Kero about it right away.\n\nThe way people think about gender roles is gradually changing, though, isn’t it?\nKero: I think so. At our concerts in the past, there’d be guys who were like, “Daddy just brought the kids” and dozing off, but now the fathers are enjoying the shows together with their children. We see more men come with babies in their arms, bringing their kids along. Times have really changed.\nIn the entertainment industry, working hours are irregular and often involve working on Saturdays and Sundays. What kind of changes do you think are needed to make it easier for women to work?\nPon: What I noticed through experiencing motherhood is that the systems in place in Japan aren’t keeping up with reality. Government workers think that women who raise children work from 9 to 5, but there are also irregular jobs like in the entertainment industry, and jobs that require working at night or staying overnight. I felt that there still aren’t many systems in place that are in line with that reality.\nWhen you’re young, you tend to think that you have to work hard to not cause trouble for other people. But as you get older and gain more experience, you start to think that it’s OK to ask for help. Can you give some advice to people who might be trying too hard, on how they can make things a little easier?\nPon: If you have someone you can talk to about how you feel, that alone can make a difference. It can be your friend, your partner, or someone you’re connected to through social media. The important thing is not to keep everything bottled up inside.\nWhen I was living in Nagano, I was at a loss about how to balance work and childcare after my divorce, and really struggled with the question of whether I should move back to Tokyo or stay in Nagano. I didn’t know if I could continue my career and felt like I was up against a wall. I was at my wit’s end, so I called a professor from when I was studying childcare who’d been very helpful to me in the past. I was crying, saying, “I don’t know what to do anymore.” Then that professor said to me, “Have you discussed that with your kids?”\n\nWhat? Your kids?\nPon: Yes, my kids were in third grade at the time. So I said, “They’re still so young, I can’t ask them for advice,” but she was like, “What are you talking about? You’re family, right? They might say something insightful, even if they’re kids.” So I went home and spoke to them during dinner. “Mommy’s really worried. Should we go back to Tokyo, or stay here in Nagano? Should I quit my job and do something else? What do you think?” Then, after thinking about it for a while, my kids said, “We’ve gotten used to living here, so we think you should stay and keep doing what you do.” They both agreed.\nSo your kids’ words led to a big decision in your life.\nPon: Right. That’s why it’s really important to talk things over. If you just ask without assuming that no one will understand or some specific person won’t understand, you might get an unexpected answer that opens up a new path.\n—This interview by Rio Hirai (SOW SWEET PBLISHING) first appeared on Billboard Japan\nGet weekly rundowns straight to your inbox\nA daily briefing on what matters in the music industry\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form.\nA daily briefing on what matters in the music industry\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form.\nBillboard is a part of Penske Media Corporation. © 2025 Billboard Media, LLC.

        "headline": "A Complete List of BTS’ Solo Projects (So Far)",
        "body": "The K-pop stars are focusing on personal projects, but existing songs give a taste of what's \"Yet to Come\" for each member's solo career.\nThe members ofBTSare going solo — but don’t worry,they are not disbanding.\nJust days after the release of their anthology albumProof— released as a celebration of the septet’s ninth anniversary — RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jung Kook shared in a video posted June 14, 2022, that they planned to take a break from group activities so they can all have time to work on personal and solo endeavors.\nThough the respite will give BTS much-needed time to work on their solo efforts — not to mention perform the mandatory military service — the group has already given fans a taste of what they are capable of apart from the group. RM, who functions as the leader of the group and member of BTS’ rap line (alongside Suga and J-Hope), was the first to drop solo material. In 2015, he released a self-titled mixtape via SoundCloud that contained a total of 11 tracks, some of which sampled songs by J. Cole, Drake, Run the Jewels and more.\nSuga followed shortly after with the arrival of hisAgust Dmixtape in 2016, while J-Hope followed in 2018 withHope World. (RM put out a second mixtape,Mono., in late 2018, while Suga put out his second tape,D-2,in May 2020).\nHere are all of BTS’ solo projects and songs — not including covers, solo tracks released through (or featuring members of) BTS, or features on other artists’ songs.\nRMwas the first member to release a solo project and shared his self-titled mixtape,RM, on March 20, 2015. The mixtape, which contained a total of 11 tracks, saw the BTS group leader reflecting on his doubt and internal struggles while also affirming his belief in himself as a talented rapper. The mixtape contained three singles: “Do You,” “Awakening” and “Joke.”\nRM later followed up his debut mixtape with the release ofMonoin 2018. This time around, the rapper went for a more collaborative effort with writing and producing the tracks, tapping Honne, Supreme Boi, Sam Klempner, Hiss Noise, Adora and more to craft the mixtape’s more introspective sound. “Forever Rain” was released as the only single from the body of work. The album charted at No. 26 on theBillboard 200.\nWatch RM’s “Do You” music video.\nAgust D,Suga‘s debut mixtape, arrived in 2016 — and with it, a bold new persona and stage name for the BTS rapper. The release was a departure for the BTS star, highlighting his hardcore rap and underground influences with help from writer-producers Slow Rabbit, June, Pdogg and Supreme Boi. “Agust D” and “give it to me” were released as the two singles for the project.\nSuga followed up the mixtape in 2020 withD-2. The mixtape was helpful to the rapper as he started focusing on his experiences as a then-28-year-old as opposed to reflecting on his past. The mixtape was commercially successful, charting at No. 9 on theTop Rap Albumschart and No. 11 on the Billboard 200.\nWatch Suga’s “Agust D” music video.\nJ-Hopeis the only rapper of BTS with only one mixtape out, but he’s hard at work on a new album. Hope’s solo debut,Hope World, arrived in 2018 and served as an introduction to him as a rapper outside of BTS and a reflection on his road to becoming a producer. The project, led by singles “Daydream” and “Airplane,” charted at No. 19 on Top Rap Albums and No. 38 on the Billboard 200.\nHe revealed on June 26, 2022, thathis solo album,Jack in the Box, would be arriving on July 15, making him the first member of BTS to launch a solo release after the global superstars announced that they would be taking some time to focus on their personal projects.

It honestly just felt like I was on stage with you guys performing this song. So, hopefully we’ll do that together.”\n\nHe continued: “Before this collaboration, Ikky and I always used to talk about how we wanted to do something out here with our music,” says the 28-year-old who was seated next to Tedder while on the quick trip to Los Angeles to shoot the video. “And then he had mentioned you guys were talking and I thought he was just kidding. Like, it’s not gonna happen. And then I remember being on tour Ikky sends me a rough draft  and the first thing I hear is [Ryan] singing. And then it’s me jumping in with my Punjabi verse.

        "headline": "Balloon, Reol & Sheeno Mirin on Their Collaboration ‘Redire,’ Vocaloid Culture That Connects Them",
        "body": "The three artists talked about the process of reinterpreting \"Redire\" and reflected on their shared roots: Niconico and Vocaloid culture.\nByBillboard Japan\nBalloon, one of the 2010s most iconic Vocaloid producers, has created hit song after hit song, like “Charles.” In 2017, he also began creating music under the name Keina Suda. On April 16, 2025, he will be releasing a new concept album,Fall Apart.\nBillboard Japantook the occasion of the new release and the “VOCALOID Collection (VocaColle) – 2025 Winter” (a submission-based Vocaloid event held on Niconico) to talk with Reol, and Sheeno Mirin, who joined Balloon on “Redire,” one of the songs on the new album. The three artists talked about the process of reinterpreting “Redire” and reflected on their shared roots: Niconico and Vocaloid culture.\n\nReol, Sheeno. How long have you two known Balloon?\n\nReol: I first discovered Balloon when I heard “I touched a vase.” Afterwards, I saw the live-action music video for “MOIL,” which he created as Keina Suda. I started paying close attention to him in part because of his artistic style, going from the Vocaloid scene to singing using his own voice, and in part because the timing of his major label debut was very close to my own. Going back through his past music, I discovered that this was the person behind Balloon.\nBalloon: Before I knew it, Reol and I were friends. I don’t remember how I found out about Reol, but one thing that made a big impression on me was the music video for “Give me a break Stop now.” At the time, people who had come up through Niconico were very cautious when it came to revealing themselves. Reol, on the other hand, just burst out of the gates. I hadn’t met her yet, but she made a really big impression on me as someone with an incredibly strong spirit, which also came across in the way she presented herself.\nSheeno: I think I found out about Balloon through “Charles” when I was in elementary school. When I was in elementary school, all I listened to was Vocaloid, and I especially loved Vocaloid rock.\nReol: When I first found Niconico, Vocaloid made a huge impression on me, too. Vocaloid’s not the name of a musical genre but the name of the software, so Vocaloid culture includes all kinds of different music. Every day, people were uploading new songs, so it was really exciting and I was just glued to it.\nBalloon, what led you to reach out to these two to work on “Redire” for your new albumFall Apart, which comes out on April 16?\n\nBalloon: I’d like to answer that by first talking about when I wrote “Redire.” At the time, I’d been thinking about starting to release music under the name Keina Suda. Back then, when people emerged from the Vocaloid culture, there was always this risk that they’d never be able to return to the Vocaloid scene. So when I was writing “Redire,” I was thinking “this just might be my last Vocaloid song.” On top of that, I was juggling way too much at the time. For some of the songs I wrote, I was in such a conflicted state of mind that after I finished the songs, I couldn’t bring myself to listen to them myself for a while.\nUnlike me, Reol is really strong—in her lyrics, in her singing voice, and as a person—and that strength is apparent to anyone who sees her. I wanted to hear Reol take these songs that I’d written with such mixed emotions in the past and sing them in a bright, radiant style.\nReol: Keina always felt like a colleague or a classmate. There’s what I’d almost call a kind of pressure felt by people who started out on Niconico and went on to debut on a major label. A feeling that they have to create output that can make them proud to have roots in the Niconico scene. So hearing Keina say that when he wrote “Redire,” he was ready to bid a temporary farewell to the culture, I thought, “Ah, so that’s why you let me work on it.”\nBalloon: I think I found out about Sheeno through “Heterodoxy.” Of course, I love it as a tune in its own right, but I also thought “his musical sensibilities are the exact opposite of my own.” I felt envious—he was doing something I couldn’t do even if I tried. That got me thinking about how a person like that would reinterpret one of my own songs. I couldn’t even imagine what it would sound like if Sheeno’s music and Reol’s music intersected.\n\nThe album is titledFall Apart,which carries this nuance of “destruction.” Balloon, did you make any requests of these two when you asked them to work on the album?\nBalloon: For me, personally, the album’s title has a hidden theme, a hope that that’s what would happen, but I didn’t make any specific requests. I just trusted in everyone’s own interpretations.\nSheeno: I really agonized over it (laughs). The original song is just too perfect. But when I heard Reol would be doing the vocals, I started thinking that an electro sound would be a good fit. It’s a sound I use in my own music, and it matches Reol’s musical sensibilities, too. I designed the sound of the song to emphasize the restlessness of the original by speeding up the BPM and adding some sharp-edged synth.\nReol: I think it came out feeling even more heartfelt. I discovered Mirin through “Then Your Thought Should Just Die,” and my impression was that he had a really powerful personal philosophy which came out in the songs he wrote. When the new arrangement of “Redire” arrived, the lyrics were Balloon’s, but in the sound you got a strong feeling of Sheeno Mirin’s philosophy.\nBalloon: I know. I listened to Sheeno’s new arrangement, before Reol recorded her vocals, and it was a huge surprise. It was like something completely new and unknown. I knew I’d made the right choice in reaching out to him.\nFor all three of you, your roots lie in Niconico. What kind of place was it for you?\nBalloon: In one word, “home.” It’s a place that will always welcome you back, and if you go out into the world, you can feel proud that your roots are in Niconico.\n\nReol: Initially, for me, it was an escape. There was a time when I just didn’t feel like I had a place in the world. When I discovered Niconico, it was like it accepted all of my gloom.\nSheeno: Earlier, Reol talked about how all kinds of things came together in Vocaloid. That’s how I felt about Niconico. That foundation is the reason that there are so many genres of Vocaloid songs, and why you can find truly niche songs.\nYou’re all taking part in theVocaColle 2025 Winter playlist project.What criteria did you use when choosing songs?\nBalloon: I picked songs that shaped who I was a decade ago. There’s a lot of music on Niconico that made a huge impression on me, but I picked the true giants, artists that are like “you can’t talk about Niconico without talking about them.”\nReol: My theme was “another style of schoolhouse.” I put the songs in chronological order, and I included songs from recent years. It goes without saying that the songs I cover are all songs I would recommend, so for my playlist I limited myself to songs I haven’t covered.\nSheeno: I have my own playlist of about 2,000 songs that have less than 10,000 plays, so I selected at random from that list. A long time ago, I tried to listen to every single Vocaloid song on Niconico, and there are lots of great songs with few plays. I want people to know that.\n—This interview by Yuuka Higaki first appeared on BillboardJapan\nGet weekly rundowns straight to your inbox\nA daily briefing on what matters in the music industry\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form.\nA daily briefing on what matters in the music industry\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form.\nBillboard is a part of Penske Media Corporation. © 2025 Billboard Media, LLC.

        "body": "The star is currently in Australia on her Hit Me Hard and Soft trek.\nByHannah Dailey\nBillie Eilishis moving full steam ahead in 2025, with the pop star teasing in a recent interview that she’s ready to get back in the studio following last year’s hit albumHit Me Hard and Soft— that is, whenever she finds the time while on tour this year, something she hinted might not end as soon as fans think.\nWhile in Australia for the latest leg of her global Hit Me Hard and Soft trek, Eilish was candid about her plans for the next 12 months in an interview withHit Networkposted Wednesday (Feb. 26). “Definitely getting back into the studio and doing stuff,” she began. “I mean, I definitely have more tour.”\n\n“Lots of tour to do,” she added, before teasing, “Probably more than I’m even scheduled for that’s going to come, which I’m excited about.”\n\nEilish is currently booked through the end of June, with the “Lunch” singer scheduled to embark on a European leg shortly after her Australian run of dates ends in March. So far, she’s completed four shows in Brisbane and two of four nights in Sydney.\nBefore that, the nine-time Grammy winner spent about two months touring through North America before closing out with five shows at the Kia Forum in Inglewood, Calif. Just before shipping off to Australia, Eilish performed her hit single “Birds of a Feather” at the 2025 Grammys, wherethe song was also nominated for song and record of the year, whileHit Me Hard and Softwas up for album of the year; she ended up losing to Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us” for both song categories, and Beyoncé’sCowboy Carterfor AOTY.\nThe “What Was I Made For?” artist has still had a banner year with her third studio album, which debuted at No. 2 on theBillboard 200. “Birds of a Feather” — which peaked at No. 2 on theBillboard Hot 100— was also one of the most streamed songs of 2024, withSpotify reportingin January that the buoyant love song beat out all other tracks on the platform last year.\nWhile speaking toHit Network, however, Eilish revealed that she truly had no idea the LP would be received so well. “I’ve definitely learned that I never have any idea what people are gonna like or not like,” she told the outlet. “In the making of this album, I had a couple moments of like, ‘They’re not going to like it; people aren’t going to like it; it’s not good enough; what if it’s not universal?'”\n\n“And then, I gave it up and thought, ‘You know what? I don’t care at all,'” she added. “‘I’m not making this for anyone but myself.'”\nWatch Eilish hint at getting back in the studio and adding more tour dates above.\nGet weekly rundowns straight to your inbox\nA daily briefing on what matters in the music industry\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form.\nA daily briefing on what matters in the music industry\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form.\nBillboard is a part of Penske Media Corporation. © 2025 Billboard Media, LLC.

        "body": "\"She has something for everything,\" the athlete said of his superstar girlfriend.\nByHannah Dailey\nLike millions of Swifties everywhere,Travis Kelce‘s emotional-support artist isTaylor Swift— especially following his recent heartbreak at the 2025 Super Bowl.\nOn the latest episode of theirNew Heightspodcast posted Wednesday (Feb. 26), the tight end and his older brother, retired Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce, opened up about the music they listen to when they each feel “depressed.” “The only way you can find yourself in the light is to find yourself in the dark first,”Travis said.\n\n“I listen to music that is very telling of my mood,” he continued. “I just listen to Taylor’s music. She has something for everything.”\n\nThat includes “how the Eagles broke my heart,” Travis added.\n“That’s a good point,” agreed Jason, who said he favors “sad country songs.” “No matter what mood, you can find some Taylor music.”\nIndeed, Travis’ superstar girlfriend has a diverse catalog spanning nearly 20 years, featuring joyous anthems, sweet love songs and angry headbangers — but she’s arguably most loved by diehard fans for her canon of sad heartbreak ballads, fromSpeak Now‘s “Last Kiss” toRed‘s “All Too Well” andThe Tortured Poets Department‘s “loml.” Such tracks are most likely the ones theGrotesqueriestar has been bumping following the Kansas City Chiefs’ loss to the Philadelphia Eagles at the Super Bowl earlier this month — which Swift attended — an event that left Travis visibly emotional in the moments directly afterward at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans.\nTravis also got choked up over the loss during his firstNew Heightsepisodeback after the game. “It’s a tough pill to swallow,” he said on the Feb. 12 installment. “It’s a hard reality, man … Chiefs Kingdom, I’m sorry for how it ended.”\nWatch the newest episode ofNew Heightsabove.\nGet weekly rundowns straight to your inbox\nA daily briefing on what matters in the music industry\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form.\nA daily briefing on what matters in the music industry\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form.\nBillboard is a part of Penske Media Corporation. © 2025 Billboard Media, LLC.

        "body": "The singer has been dropping hints about her much-anticipated new single for the past few weeks.\nByStephen Daw\nPride Editor\nChappell Roan‘s fans have been begging the singer to debut her unreleased song “The Giver” for months now — and it’s clear that the singer was listening.\nIn a post to herTikTokon Wednesday night (Feb. 26), Roan shared the first glimpse at the studio recording of the song’s first verse. The song, which the “Hot to Go!” singer first debuted onSaturday Night Liveback in November, appears alongside a hilarious series of photoshopped pictures of Chappell to match its lyrics.\n“Ain’t got antlers on my walls/ But I sure know mating calls/ From the stalls in the bars on Friday night,” Roan’s voice sings, while filtered photos of her sporting deer antlers, popping out of a toilet and disguised as a mug of beer appear on the screen. “And other boys may need a map/ But I can close my eyes/ And have you wrapped around my fingers like that.”\n\nThe new video is just the latest in a string of teasers Roan has shared for the new song. Last week, the singer debuted a series of billboards around the country advertising fake legal services, asking fans to call the number listed if they needed someone to “get the job done.” Fans who called the number were treated to a short snippet of the song played over the phone.\nThe star later shared two forthcoming vinyl variants of the song on her Instagram — “The Lawyer” and “The Plumber” editions — with each pre-order slated to ship “on or around Aug. 18,” according to her website.\n“The Giver” will be Roan’s first official release since last year’s “Good Luck, Babe!,” which climbed to No. 4 on theBillboard Hot 100dated Sept. 28. Currently, Roan has two songs on the Hot 100 — “Good Luck” sits at No. 36, while her queer anthem “Pink Pony Club” slots in at No. 11, falling fromits chart peakat No. 9 last week.\nCheck out Chappell Roan’s song teaser for “The Giver” below:\nWell yes.\nGet weekly rundowns straight to your inbox\nA daily briefing on what matters in the music industry\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form.\nA daily briefing on what matters in the music industry\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form.\nBillboard is a part of Penske Media Corporation. © 2025 Billboard Media, LLC.

        "body": "The track marks the boy band star's first proper release since being discharged from the South Korean military.\nByHannah Dailey\nNo,j-hopefans, you aren’t dreaming — he really is releasing a new solo project. On Wednesday (Feb. 26), theBTSstar announced a new single titled “Sweet Dreams,” featuringMiguel.\nArriving March 7, the duet will find j-hope and the “Sure Thing” musician’s voices blending over a soulful R&B-pop track as they sing about the “desire to love and be loved,” according to the press release.

The project reached No. 5 on theBillboard 200, his highest solo peak on the chart to date.\nThe “More” vocalist also paired the LPwith a docuseriesof the same name.

        "headline": "Qing Madi’s Heartfelt Storytelling & Spellbinding Afropop-Meets-R&B Melodies Have Made Up ‘The Blueprint’ for Her Burgeoning Career",
        "body": "TheI Am the Blueprintsinger-songwriter isBillboard's African Rookie of the Month for February.\nByHeran Mamo\nBillboardis expanding itsRookie of the Month interview seriesby highlighting rising stars from more genres like dance and rock. But the new crop of artists emerging out of the African continent have continued making it clearer that their music can exist beyond the borders of “Afrobeats” and should not be broadly and lackadaisically labeled as such. “It has African intonations in it,” Tems said of her genre-bending music during herWomen in Music interviewlast year.\nLike Tems, many African artists have discovered one-of-a-kind ways to express themselves that cannot fit into one box while staying true to their roots. AndBillboardis dedicating a spotlight to them through our newAfrican Rookie of the Monthseries, whichOdealkicked off in January and Qing Madi is continuing in February.\n\nQing Madilearned in high schoolthat “the only reason a queen exists is because of the king.” But her majestic moniker – pronounced “King” and spelled with a “Q” to symbolize her femininity – honors her rapid ascent in theAfrican musicspace, and foreshadows her lasting reign.\nUpon graduation, the Benin City native (real name Chimamanda Pearl Chukwuma) moved to Lagos with her family and started writing songs for the country’s stars like Skales, Iyanya and Larry Gaaga. While she was grateful her pengame paid the bills, she also postedcoverson TikTok andfreestyleswith guitarist and producer Wademix on Instagram. “He created this safe space where I could create my music even though I didn’t have a platform or anyone that was going to download it,” Madi, now 18, tellsBillboardat Soho Warehouse in downtown Los Angeles, California.\nOne day, she went to the studio to record backup vocals for Blaqbonez, and his producer Ramoni played her the beat’s warped acoustic guitar loop and subtle trap hi-hats. Madi asked Ramoni if she could freestyle over it, and her poignant debut single “See Finish” was born in 2022. “I never put out anything original, because I wasn’t bold enough and didn’t think people would like it,” shetoldBillboardin an interview last year.\nThe viral TikTok success of “See Finish” eventually landed Madi a label deal with JTON Music and Columbia Records via BuVision. With only three singles to her name – “See Finish,” “Why” and the saucy standout “Ole” – Madi opened her “Ole” collaboratorBNXN‘s six-date U.S. tour in October 2023, before dropping her eponymous debut EP the following month. The seven-track project melds her sweet R&B melodies and innocent, imaginative lyricism about embracing love and what the future holds while not letting her enemies get the best of her with irresistibly smooth Afropop production. “Vision” – a mesmerizing Afrobeats/R&B track Madi believes is “the most perfect thing I’ve ever written” – received an even dreamier remix treatment from her Columbia labelmateChlöefor the deluxe edition ofQing Madi.\n\nBut for her debut studio albumI Am the Blueprint, which dropped at the end of January, there’s only room for the Qing. She’s self-assured in the artist she’s always meant to become, and incredibly in tune with her emotions when it comes to love.\n“You can tell that this is coming from a teenager, someone who’s lived a certain life and is trying to open her heart to the public,” she says. “My music is euphoric, it’s timeless. It’s going to live 100 years, even when I’m gone.”\nBelow,Billboardspeaks with February’s African Rookie of the Month about the years-long journey of makingI Am the Bluepint, the meaning behind her blue motif, how “The Rumble in the Jungle” inspired her single “Ali Bomaye,” and why “love songs are the easiest songs to write.”\nMy first question has to be about Kendrick Lamar’sSuper Bowl halftime show performancesince you’re a superfan of his. What did you think about it?\nThere were a lot of things were I was like, “Kendriiick.” I liked the Easter eggs, especially with the [Laughs] “A minor” necklace. I liked the coordination of Uncle Sam. There was a lot of stuff I pinpointed and was like, “Wow, this is so tough.” I like the fact he didn’t start with “Not Like Us,” because that was such an expected move. It was so sick.\nWhen did you know music was your calling?\nI genuinely believed songwriting was my calling because I loved it so much. I liked impressing other people because I would sing what I had written and everyone was like, “Oh, this is so sick!” I felt fulfilled. I never had stage fright, I was quite confident, but I didn’t think the world would put me in a position where I had to sing my own lyrics. But when I blew up on TikTok, and I got signed and started performing, I was like, “Ooh, this is definitely what I’m meant to do.”\n\nI read in yourOkayAfrica interviewthat you were “very jealous” of people who got to sing your lyrics, because “people appreciated it way more, because they had a familiar face in front of it.” How did you eventually transition from songwriter to the stars to a star in your own right?\nIt was really God — because originally, I hated the fact that I couldn’t really be a face to my music. I felt like I was selling a part of me, and I couldn’t argue with it because I was getting money off of it. But then I was always intimately hurt by the fact that I couldn’t really say, “Yo, these aremylyrics you’re singing!” I didn’t think it was possible, because at the time I was doing all of this, there wasn’t a lot of African female artists that were being appreciated. This space was very small for us. Once the new people started popping up, and I popped up, I was like, “Oh, OK, y’all letting us in? Thanks.” [Laughs.]\nWhat kind of music did you grow up listening to, and how did that influence the music that you make?\nI grew up listening to Kendrick Lamar, Brandy and a lot of other artists that I’m not even certain I know their names, because I lived next to a bar [that] used to play music all night. I would fall asleep to ‘90s R&B. And then I fell in love with rap music. Because of how much storytelling Kendrick has in his songs, I always want to think my songs should have a direction, a storyline, a target. I’m trying to hit a particular nerve or emotion. I’m like, “OK, if I’m writing a heartbreak song, there has to be a reason, a subject and a person.” I also listened to a lot of Wande Coal – he’s an African GOAT, melodic genius.\n\nAnd what kind of music do you listen to now?\nKendrick Lamar. I was listening toGNX,DAMN.,To Pimp A Butterfly.It’s a nostalgia thing, because I grew up on him. Listening to him puts me back in Benin [City], in that house.\nYou’ve also sung background vocals for other artists. How did you get on Wizkid’s 2023“Diamonds” track?\nMy friend P. Prime called me and told me he needed assistance on a particular record. I pulled up to put my vocals on the song — but when I got there, I met Wizkid and Wande Coal. I was like[nervously chuckling], “Hi.” That is such a random thing to do on a Tuesday. Growing up, [I was] in school and trying to have discussions about these artists, and now I’m right in front of them [and] on their songs. It was an insane feeling.\nThey really did a good job of making me feel comfortable. [Wizkid] vocally led me on what he wanted, because he knows exactly what he wants on his record. He loved it, he was like, “Yeah, this is it. It’s perfect.”\nHow did you get Chloe on the “Vision” remix?\nFor my deluxe, I remember my team saying we have to get a feature on a record. And I’m like, “Oh, ‘American Love.’” And they were like, “No, no, no, no. We can’t hear nobody on it. We want to get a feature for ‘Vision.’” At the time, I was like, “I cannot hearanybodyon ‘Vision.’ That is my baby, do not put nobody on that record.” I was so against it. Then they went ahead and reached out to Chloe’s team and sent her the record. She recorded her verse, and they sent it to me.\nI loved it a lot, I can’t even lie. I was like, “Wow.” I never thought anyone would sound good on ‘Vision’ ‘cause it’s such an alternative track, and I’m like, “What are you going to add to it? It’s perfect.” But she really brought out a different perspective, and because she’s an R&B-based artist, it was such a perfect blend.\n\nWhen you toured the U.S. for the first time with BNXN in 2023, how was seeing your fans live and the way they received your music?\nIt was great. I had never traveled to America before in my life, so [it’s] my first time in America and I’m going on tour. I got to meet fans, like, “How do people even know me?” I was shocked.\nBNXN [is] the best big brother in the entire world. He would always hype me up on stage and say, “Everybody say, ‘Go Madi! Go Madi!’” It was less of a performance and more of a family reunion. It felt great being on stage and knowing that music is beyond my geographical area. The world is actually paying attention.\nWhat’s your favorite place that you’ve performed at, and why?\nUganda. It wasmyconcert, and as a new artist, that is an insane thing to do. Having a whole country that I’ve never been to – I don’t have any relatives from there, I don’t know anyone from there, it’s a place that is so alien to me – and receiving so much love, it’s definitely a significant place in my mind.\nTake me back through the making of your debut albumI Am the Blueprint.\nThere are songs from different versions of me as a person. There are songs I wrote when I was 14, when I was 16, when I was 18. I’m 18 now. It’s like a letter to myself. The first record is called “Bucket List.” It’s me prophesying a bunch of things I want to achieve, and saying, “I hope I become that artist.” And the last record is called “Right Here.” It’s me being more confident and being like, “I’m that artist.” It’s a confirmation.\nI Am the Blueprintis a journey of me growing to discover that I am the blueprint. It doesn’t start with so much confidence. It starts with this 14-year-old girl confirming that, “This is who I am, this is who I believe I am” — and it ends with this is who I’ve become.\n\nExplain the blue motif that’s not only been central toI Am the Blueprintbut your overall aesthetics, from your hair to your style.\nAccording to my mom, I’ve loved blue since I was literally conscious. It’s funny, because I was born left-handed, so she would beat my hand and tell me, “No, no, you’re doing things the wrong way. You’re supposed to use your right hand. Pink is for girls.”\nI never changed. Every time, I’d be like, “I want it in blue.” Whenever I talk about blue or I implement blue in my hair or my album, it’s me putting in that little piece of me, that younger version of me, in everything I’m doing. If I have blue hair, I’m trying to say Chimamanda is still there. That blue is a remembrance of her.\nLove plays a paramount role in this album, from feeling that intense chemistry for the first time with someone special on “Goosebumps” to questioning if your feelings are even valid or reciprocated on “It’s a Game.” Are you singing from personal experiences, or where does your source of inspiration come from?\nLove songs are the easiest songs to write, because when I used to write for other artists, I prioritized putting myself in different people’s situations because they were very specific. They would say, “I want to buy a love song about this,” and tell you exactly what they wanted. I play with it sometimes. I have songs like “Ole” that talk about wanting another person’s partner. I’m like, “How crazy would it be to talk about love from this perspective?” So when it comes to love songs, it’s just me playing with my imagination and trying to talk about love in every way possible because it’s such a broad topic.\n\nConsidering this album reflects the emotional roller coaster that comes with being in a relationship, how did you figure out the sequencing of the tracks?\nI purposefully arranged them to tell a story. We have “Bucket List,” “Ali Bomaye” and “Akanchawa,” and you can tell that slowly this person is growing from a very positive, energetic person to a very rage-filled person. From there, you slowly lurk into songs like “Pressure” and “Damn It All” that are so aggressive that you’re like, “Where does she come from?” In the beginning of the album, it was so welcoming and we’re just trying to lure you into this person who was so sweet and saw the world from this angle, and now she’s growing into realizing not everyone is as pure as she imagines.\nIt’s a journey of my emotions as a person and how I’ve seen life. The album sequencing is very intentional. I feel like we got the perfect arrangement to tell that story.\n“Ali Bomaye” is derived from the chant yelled during Muhammed Ali and George Foreman’s 1974 match in Zaire (now called the Democratic Republic of Congo), also known as “The Rumble in the Jungle.” How did you find inspiration from that?\nI learned that in school, and I was like, “That is so tough.” Having a word that is so significant to a violent sport put into love was something I thought would be so sick. Some people say, “You knock me off my feet,” like the wind. And I’m like, “You knock me off my feet,” becauseliterallyhe knocked his opponent off. It’s wordplay for me — and then, obviously, referencing the legend Muhammed Ali is. It shows how deep in knowledge I am about being descriptive about my love toward you.\n\nIf you grew up in Lagos, Lagos is such a busy place, everything is always on the go. The record “Ali Bomaye” is about living in this place where there’s so much stress — but when you meet that person, it just knocks you off your feet.\nBNXN, Chloe and Kizz Daniel were all featured on the deluxe version of your self-titled EP last year. Why did you decide to not have any features onI Am the Blueprint?\nWith the album, I really wanted to be selfish. I wanted to show the world, “This is about me. This is not about any other artist.” There are so many artists that would have sounded so great with a lot of the records, but I’m more concerned about showing you who I am. It’s a statement, it’s a movement, it’s a whole confirmation. That’s the artistic part of it.\nOn the business side, you could put a bunch of artists and say it’s for promotion. But I’m a true artist — I really care more about making sure that my message is heard and I’m able to accomplish the artistry I’m going for.\n“Bucket List”mentions some things on your bucket list that you want to accomplish, like winning a Grammy and buying your mom a mansion. What else is on your bucket list?\nDefinitely tour. I want to go on tour so bad. There are so many countries I’ve never been to, and the fact that I’m not going as a regular person is intriguing to me. I want to meet my fans all over the world. I would try different aspects of art – acting, maybe screenwriting.\nWhat’s been the biggest “pinch me” moment of your career so far?\nNaomi Campbell followed me on Instagram. I was like, “No freaking way!” And then I saw she commented, and I was like, “OK, stop.” It was a lot for me, because it’s Naomi Campbell.\n\nWho would you love to collaborate with this year?\nI would love to collaborate with Wande Coal, Fave, Chris Brown, Billie Eilish. Kendrick Lamar. I would love to collaborate with him for sure.\nWhat’s next for Qing Madi in 2025?\nMore collaborations — so many surprises that me and my team are working on. I can’t wait for the whole world to be a part of it.\nGet weekly rundowns straight to your inbox\nA daily briefing on what matters in the music industry\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form.\nA daily briefing on what matters in the music industry\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form.\nBillboard is a part of Penske Media Corporation. © 2025 Billboard Media, LLC.

She was like, ‘It’s really spicy.’ She told me to take ice cream.”\n\nAs she answered questions about being multilingual, working with Rosalía on single “New Woman” and making her acting debut on the latest season ofWhite Lotuswhile eating progressively tongue-numbing wings, LISA — though still having to dab her face and air out her tongue — fared better overall than ROSÉ. (The latter struggled quite a bit with the Scoville levels, whichbrought her to tearsand led her to deliver a few meaningful last words to her dog, Hank, just in case she didn’t “survive.”)\n\nIn fact, the “Lalisa” musician at one point jokingly boasted, “I’ll show Rosie that I’m not going to cry. I won’t cry. I’ll prove her wrong.”\nThe K-pop star’s appearance on the show comes one day ahead of her debut solo album,Alter Ego. Led by singles “Rockstar,” “Moonlit Floor (Kiss Me)” and “Born Again” with Doja Cat and RAYE, the Feb. 28-slated project finds LISA exploring five different sides of her personality expressed through characters named Roxi, Kiki, Vixi, Sunni and Speedi.\n“It represents five characters of me as well, like I feel related with them,” she told Evans of the concept. “It feels like I can express myself in a different version of me, and it’s fun. I can’t wait for my fans to listen to this album, to really enjoy this album and see a different side of LISA.”\nLISA also shared her unorthodox trick for handling spicy foods — not that she fell back on it during herHot Onesappearance. “It’s a little too crazy, but it really helps when I have something too spicy,” she told Evans as one particularly hot wing sent her into a slight panic. “I have to take my saliva out, and I can be like, ‘Nothing happened!’ I want to do it now, but I know it’s going to be so bad on the camera.

Of her decision to move locations, the musician wrote, “I cannot in good conscience play at The Kennedy Center with the change in programming direction forced on the institution by this new board.”\n\n“The Kennedy Center show was booked long before the current administration decided to take over this previously bipartisan institution,” Giddens explained in her post. “I will say here that I don’t judge anyone for choosing to go on with their shows; it’s a highly difficult situation for artists right now and everyone has to do what makes the most sense for them in the moment.”\n\nThe artist also noted that all tickets to her original Kennedy Center show will be refunded at point of purchase.\nGiddens’ statement comes almost two weeks afterTrump firedmany on the board of trustees for the Kennedy Center — a historically bipartisan institution that first opened its doors in 1971 — and named his own supporters in their places. The new board then elected Trump as its new chairman, after which the POTUS shared his plans on Truth Social to put an end to programming “targeting our youth,” specifically naming drag performances as a so-called example.\nThe consequences of Trump’s promise have already taken effect in the weeks since, with the Kennedy Centerrecently cancelingthe Gay Men’s Chorus of Washington’s scheduled Pride Month performance at the venue. On Instagram, the members of the ensemble wrote that they were “deeply disappointed” with the decision in a statement.\nGiddens is only the latest performer to pull out of Kennedy Center obligations in protest of the changes, withIssa Rae cancelingher planned appearance at the venue around the same time Philadelphia rock band Low Cut Connie canceled its concert there earlier this month. Ben Folds has also left his position as adviser to the National Symphony Orchestra, while Shonda Rhimes has resigned as treasurer of the center’s board.\n\nIn a statement announcing the cancellation, Rae explained that her decision was due to “what I believe to be an infringement on the values of an institution that has faithfully celebrated artists of all backgrounds through all mediums.”\nGet weekly rundowns straight to your inbox\nA daily briefing on what matters in the music industry\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form.\nA daily briefing on what matters in the music industry\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form.\nBillboard is a part of Penske Media Corporation. © 2025 Billboard Media, LLC.

We haven’t missed a beat,” bassist Pierre de Reeder said in a statement. “The stakes are only to have a good time, to revel in this nostalgia.

        "headline": "Inside Michelle Trachtenberg's tragic final years: Buffy actress, who was a child star and anti-drugs and alcohol campaigner, was 'struggling' after liver transplant and links to Hollywood abusers",
        "body": "ByREBECCA LAWRENCE FOR MAILONLINE\nPublished:12:37 GMT, 27 February 2025|Updated:16:29 GMT, 27 February 2025\n\n30\nViewcomments\n\nWith a TV career that started at the age of three and huge sitcom hits such as Gossip Girl and Buffy The Vampire Slayer,Michelle Trachtenbergshould have been on a path to the same Hollywood stardom many of her co-stars have since enjoyed.\nYet behind the scenes, friends say that Trachtenberg was 'struggling' in the years before her life wastragically cut short this week aged just 39, with police sources revealing the star died of natural causes and may have suffered complications following a liver transplant.\nRumours quickly began to swirl about Trachtenberg having analcoholproblem, but  for years, the actress had been vocal about her anti drink and drug stance, saying that she'd been taught well by her 'protective' mother to avoid the temptations that come with fame.\nAnd yet, somewhere along the line, it appears that Michelle was derailed by both mental and physical battles, with friends describing how she'd been 'really down emotionally', not to mention the physical toll a major procedure like an organ transplant takes.\nAlthough she was rumoured to be in talks to appear in a Buffy reunion, her career had floundered too with no significant acting roles to her name in the last 10 years - her most recent work being hosting a truecrimeseries, Meet, Marry, Murder.\nIn 2022, she made a startling claim – supporting allegations from Buffy co-star Charisma Carpenter that director Joss Whedon exhibited 'hostile and toxic' behavior on set and that there was a 'rule' in place on set prohibiting him from being alone with her.\nInside Michelle Trachtenberg's tragic final years as former child star and anti-drugs and alcohol campaigner 'struggled' after liver transplant (pictured February 12)\nTrachtenberg was found dead by her mother on Wednesday in her New York City apartment near Columbus Circle just after 8am local time (pictured November 2023)\nHowever, she was not immune from the pitfalls of fame, having spoken out when rumours of 'cruelty' emerged against Buffy The Vampire Slayer creator Joss Whedon (pictured with co-star Sarah Michelle Gellar)\nTrachtenberg said that Whedon was 'not appropriate' in his behaviour but did not elaborate further. Whedon has denied the allegations.\nWhatever she may have experienced working in the TV industry, Michelle still appeared keen to restart her career, which began with a commercial for Wisk laundry detergent when she was three years old.\nShe returned to her role as Georgina Sparks in two episodes of a Gossip Girl sequel in 2022, but the reboot failed.\nAnd in addition to her career woes, some clues as to her mental state lie in tributes from friends and colleagues who have referred to her struggles, with Amanda de Cadenet suggesting that the actress had spent her last months in and out of hospital - and even knew her time was running out.\nPaying tribute in a since-amended post, she wrote on Instagram: 'I will not share the details of our conversations over the last 6 months. But you knew that death was a high possibility.'\nMeanwhile, Rosie O'Donnell - her co-star in Harriet the Spy, which was Michelle's breakout film role at the age of 11 - commented: 'I loved her very much. She struggled the last few years. I wish I could have helped.'\nThe actress 'told friends she was struggling' and was 'really down emotionally' in the year prior to her death, a source told People.\nTrachtenberg appeared to have avoided the so-called 'child curse', which often sees young actors fall into a pattern of substance abuse issues, legal problems, and court appearances (pictured in 2000)\nTrachtenberg raised concerns among her fans after sharing 10 Instagram posts over the past three weeks ahead of her death at age 39 (pictured in 2013)\nHaving begun her TV career at just three years old, Trachtenberg spent her childhood in the spotlight\n'She was really, really sick and open with those in her circle about how much she was struggling,' the insider added, stating she looked 'pale, gaunt' and 'very thin.'\nIn the wake of her death, rumours have inevitably started to swirl that the actress had a problem with alcohol, but this remains unconfirmed and by her own account, she was very much against substance abuse.\nAs a child, Trachtenberg joined forces with then-US President Bill Clinton to help him launch The Coalition for a Drug-Free America political initiative.\nShe also advocated for Recording Artists, Athletes, and Actors Against Drunk Driving (RADD) and Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE).\nDuring an interview with Complex magazine in 2012 she was asked how she avoided the pitfalls of being a child star - so many of whom have publicly battled with addiction.\nAlthough her parents encouraged her on-screen roles from an early age, and moved from New York to LA as her career took off, she's spoken about how her Russian mother, a bank manager, and her father, a fibre-optics technician from Germany, were the opposite of pushy.\nThe actress 'told friends she was struggling' and was 'really down emotionally' in the year prior to her death, a source told People (pictured February 9, 2024)\nIn January 2024, she slammed speculation that she was in poor health after some of her followers expressed worry over her seemingly 'thinning hair' and 'yellow eyes'\nShe explained: 'My mom was protective, but she just said, \"It's your choice—you ruin your career or don't.\" If you realize how lucky you are to be sitting in the position you are, then you just don't drink, don't do the cocaine.\n'\"The cocaine!\" I call it \"the weed.\" I'm drug dumb. I don't know s**t about drugs. I just don't do that because I would never do anything to - God forbid - ruin my career. I value my career.'\nAsked how she coped being around drugs and alcohol in Hollywood, she explained: 'I've been in situations where I've been petrified of putting my purse down because I was traveling the next day and I knew that there was stuff on the counter. I'm just overly paranoid.'\nHer stance was refreshing for a former child star.\nTrachtenberg appeared to have avoided the so-called 'child curse', which often sees young actors fall into a pattern of substance abuse issues, legal problems, and court appearances.\nHowever, she was not immune from the pitfalls of fame, having spoken out when rumours of 'cruelty' emerged against Buffy The Vampire Slayer creator Joss Whedon.\nAs a child, Trachtenberg joined forces with then-US President Bill Clinton to help him launch The Coalition for a Drug-Free America political initiative\n\nShe played Dawn Summers, the younger sister of Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and was 15 when she landed the part.\nYet 18 years after the series ended fans learned of an allegedly toxic atmosphere on set.\nThe allegations came about when Charisma Carpenter (who played Cordelia in Buffy) claimed on X/Twitter in 2021 that Whedon 'abused his power on a number of occasions' and that his behaviour intensified her 'performance anxiety' and worked to 'disempower me and alienate me from my peers'.\nShe said his creating a 'toxic' and 'hostile' work environment 'triggered a chronic physical condition from which I still suffer.'\nThe claim triggered an outpouring of similar allegations from other cast members, with Trachtenberg then claiming there was an onset 'rule' by which Whedon was not allowed to be alone in a room with her.\nBacking her castmates, Gellar issued a statement via Instagram. She wrote: 'While I am proud to have my name associated with Buffy Summers, I don't want to be forever associated with the name Joss Whedon.'\nThis prompted Trachtenberg to state: 'Thank you @sarahmgellar for saying this. I am brave enough now as a 35 year old woman....To repost this. Because. This must. Be known. As a teenager. With his not appropriate behavior....very. Not. Appropriate.\n'So now. People know. What Joss. Did. The last. Comment I will make on this. Was. There was a rule. Saying. He's not allowed in a room alone with Michelle again. [sic]'\nTrue to her word, she did not elaborate on her remarks.\nTrachtenberg also had a lengthy stint working on Nickelodeon in her childhood, notably on the Nineties series The Adventures of Pete & Pete when she was 10 years old.\nRumours have swirled of inappropriate behavior or failed safeguarding of famous cast members of Nickelodeon shows.\nNickelodeon also employed or worked with five child molesters as well as two others accused of pedophilia, court records show.\nA 2024 HBO documentary, Quiet on Set: The Dark Side of Kids TV, also investigated Dan Schneider, a controversial producer of several successful kids shows on Nickelodeon.\nQuiet on Set did not accuse Schneider of any sexual misconduct with the children on set, but aired allegations of bullying, sexism and racism which he has denied.\nTrachtenberg did not comment on any of the allegations.\nShe also spoke about being sexualised in films she was cast in after finding fame as a teenager in Buffy, describing how baring her bottom on screen for Beautiful Ohio in 2006 was 'one of the most horrendous moments of my life'.\n'It would take an army — or Martin Scorsese — to ever get me naked again,' she toldComplexmagazine.\nAny objective observer must have assumed that the sky was the limit for Trachtenberg, however, after the Gossip Girl series wrapped in December 2012, her career appeared to hit a slump from which she never truly recovered.\nAs co-stars, like Lively, Ed Westwick and Penn Badgley, moved on to bigger and better things, starring in blockbuster movies and becoming A-list Hollywood superstars, Trachtenberg's credits were limited to occasional cameos on TV series, like the action-drama NCIS in 2013 and the supernatural-series Sleepy Hollow in 2015.\nWhen those roles seemingly dried up, Trachtenberg started taking even more piece-meal parts, appearing as a guest judge on the teen cooking show, Chopped Junior, in 2016.\nFor her final TV role, Trachtenberg reprised her role of manipulative young socialite Georgina Sparks in the HBO Max Gossip Girl reboot.\nShe was also said to be working on several projects behind the camera and was a member of the Writers Guild of America.\nA restaurant worker revealed to DailyMail.com that Trachtenberg was so sick during her final outing that she could barely walk down a flight of restaurant stairs.\nThe star's gaunt appearance stunned staff at Sartiano's restaurant in SoHo, New York.\nIt was Thursday February 2, less than a week before the tragic Gossip Girl star was found dead by her mother in her Manhattan apartment.\n‘She looked really unwell, just like very sickly,' a worker said on Wednesday. 'She was thin, like tiny, she couldn’t walk down the stairs. She was not in a great mood, it wasn’t the best impression.'\n'It’s spooky because she was in here just last week on Thursday night,' the worker added.\n'We only just found out about (her death) a few hours ago and it’s really sad. She was just with one other person, a woman who was really nice.’\nIn recent years fans began to express concern for the star.\nIn January 2024, she slammed speculation that she was in poor health after some of her followers expressed worry over her seemingly 'thinning hair' and 'yellow eyes.'\nIn response to an Instagram comment saying that she looked 'sick' and asking if she was okay, the Gossip Girl alum replied: 'Fun fact. This is my face. Not malnutrition no problems. Why do you have [to] hate? Get a calendar.'\nWhile addressing another similar comment, at the time, she reminded her fans that she was 38 not 14 anymore, before inquiring in what way she looked unwell.\n'How sad for you to leave such a comment,' she concluded.\nShe also reminded the woman that she was 38 not 14 anymore, before inquiring in what way she looked unwell\nHer final Instagram post, uploaded seven days ago, was a throwback picture of her attending the Killing Kennedy premiere at the Saban Theatre on November 4, 2013 in Beverly Hills\nAdditionally, she shared a sweet tribute to her boyfriend, talent agent Jay Cohen, who she described as 'the man who sits still long enough for' her to 'paint his face'\n\nTrachtenberg reposted Gellar's statement claimed there was an onset 'rule' by which Whedon was not allowed to be alone in a room with her.\nHer final Instagram post, uploaded seven days ago, was a throwback picture of her attending the Killing Kennedy premiere at the Saban Theatre on November 4, 2013 in Beverly Hills.\n'I wanted to look like naughty #tinkerbelI #throwback,' she captioned the picture, which showed her posing on the red carpet.\nDays prior, she shared another older picture and joke about not letting the 'Sunday scaries' get to her.\nShe was clearly in a nostalgic mood as she also recently shared a snap, taken in 2011 at the School of American Ballet Winter Ball, and a cheeky suggestion for those without Valentine's Day plans to watch her true crime docuseries, Meet, Marry, Murder.\nAdditionally, she shared a sweet tribute to her boyfriend, talent agent Jay Cohen, who she described as 'the man who sits still long enough for' her to 'paint his face.'\nThe post included a sweet snap of them from Halloween dressed as Dr. Jekyll and his alter ego, Mr. Edward Hyde.\nThere has not yet been an official declaration of the cause of Trachtenberg's death.\nWhile alcoholism is the number one cause of liver disease,viruses like Epstein-Barr and hepatitis may also cause inflammation of the liver, which damages the organ over time.\nShare what you think\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\nBy posting your comment you agree to ourhouse rules.\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

        "headline": "EXCLUSIVEReal Housewives star Kameron Westcott slams Katy Perry for ruining father-in-law's dying wish in mansion war",
        "body": "ByMARJORIE HERNANDEZ WEST COAST NEWS EDITOR FOR DAILYMAIL.COM\nPublished:13:58 GMT, 27 February 2025|Updated:14:42 GMT, 27 February 2025\n\n87\nViewcomments\n\nReal Housewives of Dallasstar Kameron Westcott said her terminally ill father-in-law's final wish was to 'spend his last days' in his $15 million Montecito mansion thatKaty Perryhas now taken over.\nWestcott said her father-in-law, Carl,never intended to sellthe sprawling 9,285-square foot home to the 'Firework' pop star.\nIn an exclusive interview with DailyMail.com, Kameron said Perry is still pushing to collect $6 million from her 85-year-old father-in-law, who has been bedridden for the past year because of Huntington's disease.\n'They are not backing down,' Kameron said of Perry and the pop star's husband, Orlando Bloom. 'There's never a negotiation. They want to go through with it, and you know, for us, we want to be done with this.\nKameron Westcott said her father-in-law, Carl, hoped to spend his last days at his Montecito dream home. She said Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom are 'greedy' and refuse to back down from the ongoing lawsuit despite already obtaining legal ownership of the property.\nCarl Westcott signed a real estate contract in July 2020 to sell his home to Katy Perry but he claimed he was under the influence of opioids following back surgery. The singer's agents disregarded Westcott's plea to cancel the deal and Perry filed suit against the businessman\n'We want to focus on my father-in-law's health. We want to be with him and have the last few days peaceful. This is the last thing we want to deal with.'\nFor the past four years, the Westcotts have been embroiled in a nasty legal battle with the power couple for the 2.5-acre property in the celebrity enclave of Montecito, California.\nCarl Westcott, a retired U.S. Army veteran who was a successful entrepreneur and founded several businesses such as 1-800-Flowers, had agreed to sell the property to Perry for $15 million in July 15, 2020.\nDays later, however, he tried to reverse the sale and said his judgement was clouded by powerful medication he was taking after he had debilitating back surgery.\nWestcott had only been in the home for about two months before Perry's business manager, Bernie Gudvi, agreed to pay him $3,750,000 more than he had just bought the property.\nWestcott's attorneys argued the contract was 'voidable' because of Westcott's mental state.\nA Los Angeles judge, however, ruled in favor for Perry, who was declared the legal owner of the estate in December 2023. The singer was handed the keys in March 2024.\nKaty Perry acquired the mansion through her LLC, DDoveB, which is named for her daughter Daisy Dove Bloom.\nThe case is not over yet, as Perry and Bloom are demanding the bedridden Westcott to pay them $6 million for what they claim are extensive repairs that need to be made to the property and back rent they could've charged to potential tenants.\n'It's heartbreaking that someone can be so greedy, and it's heartbreaking that someone has no heart,' Kameron told DailyMail.com. 'I mean, I hope this never happens to her parents.\n'It breaks your heart, and I just wish that they had a little more compassion on the situation, and I wouldn't even wish this on her family. I wish it on no one's family, and I hope no one else has to go through this.'\nShortly after the 2020 sale, Perry and Bloom wrote a letter to Carl Westcott thanking the war veteran for selling them his property.\n'Though there were other properties that did interest us, yours will provide us the comfort of security, privacy and safety,' the couple wrote.\nCarl Westcott is a veteran of the U.S. Army 101st Airborne. He grew up 'dirt poor' in Mississippi but managed to gain success with auto dealerships he purchased in the lat 1960s. He also founded insurance companies and 1-800-Flowers\nThey continued: 'This home will be a respite, one where we will be able to grow together as a family.'\nKameron said reading that letter surprised her family.\n'I read that letter and I knew it was bogus,' the reality star said. 'I knew it was just a way to get him to pass the house over to [Perry], and I knew right away that [living in the home] was not their intent. ... I was just a way to try to get him to pass the house over to her.'\nKameron said Carl, who they lovingly call 'Captain', never wanted to leave the one-story 1930s home, which includes a tennis court, two guesthouses and a pool.\n'He wanted to be at rest in the place that he loves, and that's his favorite place,' she said. 'He wanted to be at peace and have his family around, and we wanted to fill those wishes for him. That's why we decided to fight for him and protect him.'\nKameron said the family decided to move 'Captain' to a memory care facility in Dallas so they are able to visit the 85-year-old as often as they can. She said Huntington's disease has lead to dementia for her father-in-law, who can only say a few words at times.\nThere are days when he can barely sit up from his bed, Kameron said.\nShe said her husband, Court, and brother-in-law, Chart, have taken on the legal battle against Perry while their dad remains in hospice care.\nKameron Westcott said her father-in-law has 'good and bad days' and is in hospice care in Dallas.\n'We just want to be there for him and make sure he's comfortable in his final few days or months,' she said. 'Every day is different. We just don't know. ... It's extremely awful.'\nKameron said Real Housewives fans and others in the community have been supportive of their family's fight against Perry and Bloom.\n'I do hope this is a good example for so many people out there to protect your parents,' the reality TV star said. 'Make sure you know what is always going on and protect them at all times because there are predators out there, and they can be taken advantage of.'\nWhile the Westcotts will never see the Montecito home again, their legal showdown against Perry is far from over.\nThe 'Roar' singer will have to provide evidence in an upcoming trial in August for her $6 million damages claim against the Westcotts.\nBloom also could be called to testify in courtsince the actor was allegedly tasked to hire the dozens of 'experts' who inspected the Montecito property, a source told DailyMail.com.\nEven Prince Harry was dragged into the feud after Kameron's brother-in-law, Chart Westcott,sent a letter to the British royal and begged him to exclude Perry from performingat the Invictus Games, an international multi-sport event for wounded and sick veterans and those still in service.\n'As our father's health declines, my brother and I are fighting to preserve his legacy, as a man and as a veteran, yet this legal struggle has become a source of immense pain for our family,' Chart wrote.\n'The choice to feature Ms. Perry at the Invictus Games feels at odds with the event's mission to honor veterans and their sacrifices.\n'While Ms. Perry's participation may be seen as a gesture of support for veterans, her relentless pursuit of our father in court tells a different story — one that deeply undermines the values the Games stand for.'\nNevertheless, Perry - who is pals and neighbors with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle - performed at the Invictus Games on February 8.\nKaty Perry performed during the opening ceremony of the 2025 Invictus Games on February 8 in Vancouver, British Columbia.\nWhen asked what she would say to Perry and Bloom if she had a chance, the former Dallas Housewife took a brief pause.\n'I actually have nothing to say to them,' Kameron said. 'I really don't. I just hope that this doesn't happen to them one day, and I wouldn't even wish it on them like. That's how horrible it is, and I hope that they can open their eyes and see that.\n'And I don't wish harm on anyone, but I really wish that they just have more compassion within themselves, and really think about things that they do that can affect other people and other people's families.'\nDailyMail.com has reached out to Perry's representatives and her attorney in the case for comment.\nShare what you think\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\nBy posting your comment you agree to ourhouse rules.\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

I recently had to lose a couple of stone because of sleep apnoea.\n'I was told that if I didn't I could be at risk of a heart attack or stroke within 10 years.\n'I feel so much better having done it because I had learnt how to change my relationship with food. But what had happened was over the years, my weight had crept up gain.\n'I went back to the origins of what I used, the company that I used and I lost it safely and effectively.'\nAccording to the NHS website, sleep apnoea is: 'When your breathing stops and starts while you sleep.'\nSome symptoms include: stopping and starting your breathing, gasping, snorting, waking up or snoring.\nLosing weight can sometimes treat the condition.\nBack in January Denise looked incredible after showing off her 2.5 stone weight loss in a blue swimsuit.\nThe star posed a snap of herself in the one piece on her Instagram story - and brutally cropped out her husband.\nShe wrote: 'The one photo of us together @lincolntownley wouldn't let me include him as \"he didn't have the right costume!!!\"'\nShare what you think\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\nBy posting your comment you agree to ourhouse rules.\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

It shows Jennifer Aniston enjoying a cigarette amid her birthday celebrations\nDespite her good-girl image, Jennifer Aniston has a long history of smoking, which she has said she's since quit.\nBut in 2022, the actress and wellness advocate was pictured lighting up amid her birthday celebrations.\nHer ex-husband, Justin Theroux, posted a video of the actor lighting a cigarette before it was quickly deleted off his Instagram story.\nJennifer, 56, has admitted she was a chain smoker for years early in her career, regularly making her way through a pack of cigarettes a day.\nBut in 2007, three years after finishing her hit show Friends, she decided to quit — saying the habit was affecting her health, energy and even relationships.\nIt doesn't appear she's regularly picked up the habit again, but it also seems she hasn't put away her lighter for good.\nBella Hadid (left, with Stella Maxwell, Paris Jackson and Ruby Rose) shown with a cigarette at the Met Gala in 2017. Later she announced she was quitting cigarettes but has since been photographed once again with a cigarette in hand\nBella Hadid is famed for her beauty and being one of the most recognisable faces in modelling.\nBut despite her glamour, reports suggest she may be partaking in the not-so-stylish habit of smoking cigarettes.\nLast year, Bellawas photographedwith a cigarette in her mouth while attending the Cannes film festival in France.\nFans were quick to respond, with one writing: 'Throw away your vapes, Bella Hadid just made smoking cigarettes cool again!'\nBella has not addressed the photographs or commented on her smoking.\nThe model has, however, admitted in the past she started smoking at the age of 14 when she said she would regularly get through a pack a day.\n'Whether it was eating disorders or smoking... I’m like, \"Oh, this is what all of the kids are doing,\"' she said.\nThe model says she resolved to quit in 2017, and then made it her New Year's resolution to alsoquit her JUUL vapein 2019.\nMany smokers have moved to e-cigarettes as a way to kick the habit, although some then end up hooked on the devices.\nDoctors have previously said e-cigarettes are better than smoking, but research is limited and long-term effects have not been documented yet because the devices are so new.\nCigarettes can help to dampen appetite, helping someone to lose weight — making them more popular among aspiring models.\nBut they can also cause damage to the skin, leading it to age or sag prematurely and have a greyish appearance. Cigarettes can also cause a yellowing of the fingernails and discoloration of the teeth.\nStacey Solomon was spotted smoking a cigarette with her morning coffee during a family day out in north London last March\nThe presenter previously discussed the unhealthy habit back in 2012, when she broke down on revealing her guilt at continuing to smoke while pregnant\nStacey Solomonwasspotted smoking a cigarette with her morning coffeeduring a family day out in north London last March.\nThe Sort Your Life Out star sneaked in a moment of silence and sparked up a cigarette while husbandJoe Swashplayed with their youngest children.\nThe presenter previously discussed the unhealthy habit back in 2012, when she broke down on This Morning and revealed her guilt at continuing to smoke while pregnant.\nAlthough she said she had cut down from her 10 a day, she has struggled to quit altogether.\nShe said on This Morning: 'At the end of the day, nothing that I can say makes it right. All I can say is that from the day I found out that I was pregnant, I have tried my best to give up. I completely understand why people would be angry, because for some people it's incomprehensible.\n'As soon as you get pregnant, you think you need so stop. I did smoke between 5 and 10 a day, but I completely cut down and from there on I have been trying to stop.\n'I'm smoking between one and three a day, if that... I just thought I would be able to quit. And some days I've done really, really well and had none but there are some days when I have had some. I'm doing my best to just go without, but sometimes it's not just as easy to cut it out.'\nDua Lipa surprised fans last month as she was spotted smoking with fiance Callum Turner as they packed on the PDA in Paris despite her proudly declaring that she'd kicked the habit\nDua Lipa surprised fans last month as she wasspotted smoking with fiance Callum Turner as they packed on the PDA in Parisdespite her proudly declaring that she'd kicked the habit last year.\nSitting in front of the Eiffel Tower, Dua, 29, and Callum, 34, didn't seem to have a care in the world as they only had eyes for one another while puffing on the cigarettes.\nHowever, during an appearance on Late Night With Seth Meyers the pop star explained that she initially gave up smoking for her Future Nostalgia tour in 2022.\nThe singer revealed she had kicked the habit in order to make sure her vocal health was at its best - before announcing she had stopped altogether.\nShe told host Seth: 'I was smoking ­cigarettes at the time... But I've stopped. I've quit, guys.'\nIt is not clear exactly when the Houdini hitmaker began smoking, but after suffering from laryngitis in December 2021 she felt the need to quit for the sake of her tour and later gushed about how much 'confidence' quitting had given her.\nSpeaking on her At Your Service podcast, she revealed: 'I had laryngitis in December and that kind of kickstarted me quitting smoking a month earlier than I was supposed to. But I did it and I have stuck to it.'\nSingers often go to great lengths to protect their voice — drinking plenty of water, avoiding caffeine and even steering clear of air conditioning.\nSmoking raises the risk of infections in the voice box, which can cause inflammation in the area — changing someone's voice and making it harder to sing.\nThe star said on her podcast: 'I had laryngitis in December and that kind of kickstarted me quitting smoking a month earlier than I was supposed to.

        "body": "ByALISON BOSHOFF\nPublished:22:28 GMT, 20 February 2025|Updated:12:26 GMT, 21 February 2025\n\n173\nViewcomments\n\nWhat a way to launch a brand! I can reveal that the homeware products which are to be sold by Meghan, theDuchess of Sussex, as part of her lifestyle range, are NOT going to feature in herNetflixcooking and entertaining show.\nSources who have watched a preview of her series – With Love, Meghan – say there is ‘no mention’ of merch in it.\nCertainly you will see Meghan making and lighting candles, using edible flowers, tablecloths, wine, jam and honey. All items which it’s understood she will be selling.\nBut at no point does she mention, on camera, that you can snap them up from her homeware range.\nThe show will stream from March 4, at which point the brand will also go live. The situation seems to indicate a lack of strategic planning.\nCould it be the result of a rush to get the show into production last spring? When cameras did start rolling, in a mansion near her home withPrince Harryin Montecito, Meghan hadn’t started producing any merchandise. Nor had she accepted Netflix’s offer to run the brand with her, as she now has.\nThe silver lining (for Meghan) could be that at the time, the brand was called ‘American Riviera Orchard’. But as Meghan explained in a video on Tuesday, the name has been changed to ‘As Ever’.\n‘Last year, I thought: “American Riviera”, that’s a great name,’ she said. ‘It’s my neighbourhood; it’s a nickname for Santa Barbara – but it limited me to things manufactured and grown in this area.’\nAlison Boshoff writes: 'I can reveal that the homeware products which are to be sold by Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, (pictured) as part of her lifestyle range, are NOT going to feature in her Netflix cooking and entertaining show'\nThe show will stream from March 4, at which point the brand will also go live\nActually, the US Patent and Trademark Office partially refused a trademark application for the name. Businesses are not allowed to trademark geographic locations.\nEven the elaborate logo, which Meghan is said to have designed herself, was criticised for being ‘inaccurate’, since the letter ‘O’ for Orchard was not easily visible.\nBut her new logo also ran into trouble, after internet sleuths noticed that the design (two hummingbirds flanking a palm tree) bore a remarkable resemblance to the coat of arms of Porreres, a town in Majorca. The owner of a clothing business called As Ever NYC is also consulting lawyers.\nThis week the Duchess said of her fledgling brand: ‘As Ever, essentially, means as it’s always been, and if you’ve followed me since 2014 with The Tig, you know I’ve always loved cooking and crafting and gardening – this is what I do.’\nMonty Don (pictured) was surprised to discover his old home in London was being advertised by estate agents as having a garden designed ‘by Monty Don’\nMonty Don was surprised to discover his old home in London was being advertised by estate agents as having a garden designed ‘by Monty Don’ . . . 36 years after he sold up.\nThe modest Victorian end-of-terrace home, between Islington and Hackney, was where Monty lived with Sarah Erskine (now his wife) in the 1980s, when they were jewellery designers.\nHe told an audience at his one-man show in Somerset: ‘The house we bought in 1981 for £30,000 was sold last year for £1.7 million. And it was advertised as having “a garden done by Monty Don” — which probably added three and sixpence to the value.’\nHe moved out after their third burglary, but said he was ‘just as happy in that 100ft by 30ft London garden as at any other time gardening since’.\nHe added: ‘Gardening is nothing to do with size, or money; it’s what you get out of it.’\nOne thing he did get out of it was a lot of scrap metal, as the previous owner used to buy cars for parts and ditch leftovers in the garden.\n‘I was turning the soil and I would suddenly hit a bonnet,’ he recalled.\nThe programme, in which survival expert Bear Grylls (pictured) ‘hunts’ celebrities, was No 1 in the UK for Netflix in its first streaming week and is now No 2\nBear Hunt looks certain to return — with the production company behind it already advertising for crew willing to spend a month working on a show ‘in Central America’, starting next month.\nThe programme, in which survival expert Bear Grylls ‘hunts’ celebrities, was No 1 in the UK for Netflix in its first streaming week and is now No 2.\nPresented by Holly Willoughby, it features Spice Girl Mel B, interior designer Laurence Llewelyn Bowen and former rugby player Danny Cipriani among the prey.\nLaunching it two weeks ago, Bear seemed confident that it would continue, remarking: ‘We’re only just getting going.’\nErin Doherty (pictured) plays Mary Carr, the bold head of all-female criminal gang The Forty Elephants in Disney+ series A Thousand Blows\nErin Doherty has come a long way from Princess Anne’s sensible tweeds and headscarves.\nThe Crown actress plays Mary Carr, the bold head of all-female criminal gang The Forty Elephants in Disney+ series A Thousand Blows, which streams from today.\nThe show, the latest from Peaky Blinders creator Stephen Knight, is based on real historical figures and focuses on bare-knuckle boxing and gangs in the East End of Victorian London.\nHandy with a pistol and a knife, Doherty’s Mary (left) is a fearsome character. But she and the rest of the gang were upstaged by a pop band during filming last year, while shooting a scene involving a raid on Harrods department store.\n‘This was a day when the Jonas Brothers were in town near our location,’ she said. ‘So there were big crowds outside, and we were wondering for most of the time: “What’s going on? Are people here to watch us raid Harrods?”\n‘But no. They were just there to see the Jonas Brothers.’\nTom Cruise and Glen Powell attends the Korea Red Carpet for 'Top Gun: Maverick' at Lotte World on June 19, 2022 in Seoul, South Korea\nTom Cruise was on ebullient form at the legendary pre-Bafta Charles Finch x Chanel party on Saturday.\nThere’s no one who brings quite the same positive energy as superstar Tom, who was directing his megawatt charm towards his many friends in the British film industry (by my count, he’s made 11 films mostly or wholly in the UK during his career).\nThere were backslaps, hugs and cocktails galore on the night – but no sign of his ‘date’, Ana de Armas, who was not among those at 5 Hertford Street.\nWord is that the two of them are thinking about working together on a film, but there is no romance.\nThere was, however, a strong whiff of bromance – with Cruise, Top Gun: Maverick producer Jerry Bruckheimer and Glen Powell, who starred alongside him in that film as hotshot flyer Hangman, forming a mutual admiration society.\nPowell has been making The Running Man in London. And Cruise is over here making an untitled thriller with Alexander Iñárritu at Pinewood — as well as editing the next Mission: Impossible film.\nPowell gushed of their bond: ‘It’s the best! He’s such a great friend and such a great mentor.’\nBefore they made Top Gun: Maverick, Cruise arranged for Powell to watch a six-hour ‘film school’ video which he had put together.\nHe also personally flew Powell back to London from Pinewood studios in a helicopter one day – terrifying him by pretending the chopper was going down.\nThe 36-year-old Texan recalled: ‘Tom goes “Oh no, oh no!” and he starts dropping the helicopter over London. I was like: “Am I about to be the unnamed guy that dies with Tom in a smoking hole in the middle of London?”'\nCruise was a surprise guest at the London premiere of Powell’s Twisters last summer.\nThe two men will be working together again soon on a sequel to Top Gun: Maverick, which has been announced officially.\nThe biggest hit of the Baftas may have been the Don Julio tequila cocktail — ‘La Musa Dorada’ — served in tiny brown bottles, and responsible for hundreds of wicked hangovers\nThe biggest hit of the Baftas may have been the Don Julio tequila cocktail served in tiny brown bottles, and responsible for hundreds of wicked hangovers.\nDon Julio was the ‘Official Spirit Partner’ of the event and also sponsored the Winners’ Bar, where the lucky few came to have their award masks engraved.\nCynthia Erivo (pictured), nominated for a Bafta for her role in Wicked, flew back to the US overnight on Sunday\nRapid exits from the UK for Best Actress hopefuls Cynthia Erivo and Demi Moore.\nCynthia, nominated for a Bafta for her role in Wicked, flew back to the US overnight on Sunday. And Demi, nominated for The Substance (but surprisingly pipped by Mikey Madison) returned on Monday.\nIt was the last day of voting for the Oscars on Tuesday, and the SAG Awards are this Monday (24th) — the final staging post before the Oscars on March 2.\nAfter a confoundingly open race, momentum has now built apparently decisively behind Anora for Best Picture, with Demi Moore, Adrien Brody, Kieran Culkin and Zoe Saldana also appearing unstoppable in the acting categories.\nJack Dee (pictured) is famous for performing in a suit, and he gets his made to measure at a legendary bespoke Soho tailor\nJack Dee is famous for performing in a suit, and he gets his made to measure at a legendary bespoke Soho tailor (popular with other comedians) formerly called Mr Eddie, but now renamed Chris Kerr.\nDee said: ‘It’s not called Eddie’s any more. It’s been taken over by his nephew.\n‘I remember when I went in there once, and there’s this huge suit hanging up to be collected, and there was also this really little tiny suit. I said: “Who are these for, then?”\n‘And he said: “The big one is for Robbie Coltrane. And the other one is for the PG Tips chimpanzee.”\n'I said: 'Based on that, I’ll probably have a medium.”’\nNicholas Galitzine (pictured) will play He-Man in the picture, scheduled for release in the States next summer.\nIt’s official: the Masters Of The Universe are British! Londoner Nicholas Galitzine will play He-Man and James Purefoy will be his dad, King Randor, in the picture, scheduled for release in the States next summer.\nHis mother, Queen Marlena, will be played by English actress Charlotte Riley — who in real life is married to Tom Hardy.\nSwedish muscle man Dolph Lundgren was the star of the original film, back in 1987.\nShare what you think\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\nBy posting your comment you agree to ourhouse rules.\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

        "body": "ByALISON BOSHOFF FOR THE DAILY MAIL\nPublished:00:07 GMT, 14 February 2025|Updated:17:37 GMT, 15 February 2025\n\n137\nViewcomments\n\nHasRussell Brandturned his back on Britain for good?\nIt can be revealed that, months after moving toFloridawith his family, Brand’s addiction and mental health charity has closed, with the Charity Commission winding it up a few weeks ago.\nThe Stay Free Foundation, which was run by 49-year-old Brand and his wife Laura, was investigated — but not sanctioned — by the Charity Commission after allegations of sexual assault and rape against the comedian surfaced in 2023.\nA spokesman for the Charity Commission said Stay Free told it in September last year it no longer operated, and this was made official in January.\nIts final accounts, for the year to June 2023, show that it had income of £126,130 and had made grants totalling £52,353 — leaving £73,777 in the bank.\nThe commission spokesman said the charity was ‘required to provide us with a declaration confirming that all its assets had been distributed in line with its charitable purposes’.\nThe Foundation’s demise may mark a complete cutting of ties with Britain for Brand. Last year he moved from his Thames-side home in Henley to a beach community in Florida, from where he fronts alt-Right videos on the Rumble site.\nIn a recent video, posted on Rumble, he said: ‘I don’t live in the United Kingdom any more because I personally have experienced how the media, government and judiciary, if you suddenly become an inconvenience, will find ways to attack and shut you down.’\nIt can be revealed that, months after moving to Florida with his family, Russell Brand’s addiction and mental health charity has closed\nThe Foundation’s demise may mark a complete cutting of ties with Britain for Brand. Last year he moved from his Thames-side home in Henley to a beach community in Florida\nThe Stay Free Foundation was set up in 2022 to give grants to organisations which helped people with addictions and mental health problems.\nIts main fundraiser was the three-day ‘Community’ festival, held in July 2023 in Hay on Wye.\nSome 5,000 people attended for yoga and breathwork sessions, a number of addresses by Brand, and a demonstration of ice bathing with Wim Hof.\nThe festival was due to go ahead again last summer, but was rescheduled without explanation for this July.\nAdult tickets costing £160, £185 and £195 are sold out, with only the most expensive (£210) available. They are still for sale.\nThe ticket site does not make it clear where the event will be held. Also unclear is where the profits from Community 2025 would go. Enquiries this week about the future of the event went unanswered.\nThe festival has not updated its Instagram page since September 2023. One customer wrote: ‘Is 2025 actually happening? No information or update since last year’s cancellation. Can we get a refund on the tickets bought for the 2024 event?’\nRussell Brand leaving the Troubabour Wembley Park theatre in north-west London in 2023\nAnother wrote: ‘Well, I assume this whole hippie festival idea has gone by the wayside, after Russell’s abrupt shift into evangelical Christianity and Right-wing US politics.’\nAccounts for Brand’s main production company, Pablo Diablo’s Legitimate Business Firm Ltd, show it has amassed more than £8 million – £3 million up on the year before.\nA Channel 4 documentary in September 2023 aired allegations of rape, sexual assault and ‘emotional abuse’ against Brand from a number of women. It prompted an investigation by the BBC, which reported last month that staff felt unable to speak up about his behaviour.\nPolice investigated the abuse allegations – which Brand has always denied – which relate to the period between 2006-2013, when he was at the height of his fame. The force is said to have handed a file to the Crown Prosecution Service last November, but to date no charges have been brought.\nKylie’s deadly date at the White House\nMinogue reunited with fellow Aussie actor Julian McMahon for the film, who was briefly married to her younger sister Dannii\nKylie Minogue sparkles — as herself — in a forthcoming Knives Out-style Netflix whodunnit called The Residence.\nThe action is set in the White House, where a Presidential aide gets murdered.\nIt’s a slice of fun from Bridgerton producers Shondaland, with Broadway star Uzo Aduba starring as detective Cordelia Cupp.\nInterestingly, Minogue is reunited with fellow Aussie actor Julian McMahon, who was briefly married to her younger sister Dannii. There’s no hard feelings, though.\nAll the Aussie Brat Pack from that period have stayed friends — and Kylie and McMahon have actually acted together before, in 2016 film Flammable Children.\nIn The Residence, McMahon plays Australian PM Stephen Roos. Which is appropriate, given his father, Sir William McMahon, actually was the Australian PM from 1971-72.\nThe film streams from March 20.\nMy heavy metal dress threw my back out\nElla Hunt and Daisy Edgar-Jones attend W Magazine's Annual Best Performances Party at Chateau Marmont\nElla, 26, appeared in Kevin Costner’s Horizon: An American Saga Chapter One and also acted in its sequel, which is yet to be released\nElla Hunt has come a long way from playing one of the twin daughters of David and Karen Marsden in Cold Feet.\nShe was a vision in metallic Fendi (left) at the Critics Choice awards in Los Angeles last weekend — banging the drum for the film Saturday Night, in which she plays comedian Gilda Radner.\n‘I threw my back out wearing this dress,’ she said. ‘It weighed like 70lbs.’\nWith a curly wig and a distinctive accent, she’s pretty much unrecognisable as the Michigan-born Radner in the film, which details the difficult birth of legendary American comedy show Saturday Night Live.\nThe native Londoner explained that mastering accents was her party trick as a kid, when she would impersonate Paulette (played by Jennifer Coolidge) in the nail salon scene of Legally Blonde.\n‘It’s just become a hobby to pick up different people’s voices. I think that’s why I live in the States; because I love doing accent work. I’d much rather be in somebody else’s voice than my own.’\nElla, 26, appeared in Kevin Costner’s Horizon: An American Saga Chapter One and also acted in its sequel, which is yet to be released.\nSweetly, she and her Cold Feet ‘twin’, Daisy Edgar-Jones, are still friends and partied together at the Baftas last year (right).\nITV defends true crime drama about Fergie’s killer dresser\nA drama series about Jane Andrews, the Duchess of York’s dresser who murdered her boyfriend, ‘won’t be an apology’ for her, according to those involved.\nITV has commissioned a four-part mini-series, The Lady, from Left Bank Pictures, who made The Crown.\nIt’s immediately attracted controversy, with the family of Andrews’ victim Thomas Cressman condemning it.\nBut director Lee Haven Jones insisted this week that the programme ‘won’t be an apology for her actions’.\n‘Jane Andrews killed somebody – it’s that simple. We will present the story of a very complex woman and do something which I think drama does very well: humanise the people involved and attempt to provide an insight into how they operated.’\nJane Andrews (pictured), now 57, was sentenced to life imprisonment and was released in 2015\nHaven Jones, who also directed A Cruel Love: The Ruth Ellis story, which comes to ITV next month, added: ‘It will be fair towards her, rather than sympathetic.’ ITV is expected to announce who is to play Andrews shortly.\nRick Cressman, whose brother Thomas was beaten with a cricket bat by Andrews as he slept, before she stabbed him in the chest in 2000, said his family were distressed by the prospect of the production.\nCressman, 73, said: ‘It feels that Tommy can never rest in peace. It’s a very cruel thing that ITV have commissioned a drama about it.’\nHotelier Mr Cressman described The Lady as an ‘out-and-out attempt to profiteer’ from the death of his brother, who was killed by Andrews at their home in Fulham, West London, after he refused to marry her.\nBrody reflects on his side career\nAdrien Brody — the bookies’ favourite to win Best Actor at the Baftas on Sunday nightand again at the Oscars next month — is a modest sort.\nDuring a conversation withA Rabbit’s Foot publisher and film-maker Charles Finch this week, he reflected on his successful side career as a painter. ‘A lot of actors are painters. It’s a lot easier tosell paintings when youare a famous actor.’\nHonest, Guv: I was never in EastEnders!\nSanjeev Bhaskar, currently starring as DI Sunny Khan in a new series of Unforgotten, keeps being identified as an EastEnders star — even though he’s never set foot in Albert Square.\nSanjeev Bhaskar keeps being identified as an EastEnders star despite never starring in the soap opera\n‘A bloke in a white van wound down his window the other day and said: “EastEnders?” I replied: “I am not in that show!” He said “Yeah, right” before driving off. And at a supermarket in Wales this woman came up and said: “You’re in EastEnders!” I again replied: “No I’m not.”\n‘She then re-approached me elsewhere in the supermarket and said: “You ARE in EastEnders...my husband says you are.”\nGascon set to miss Oscars\nThe star of Emilia Perez, Karla Sofia Gascon, will be absent from the Baftas on Sunday, after the fallout from apparently homophobic and racist tweets ended her campaign season. It now looks as if Gascon won’t attend the Oscars next month either.\nAs for the Baftas, there’s chatter that Conclave will scoop Best Picture, and that Ralph Fiennes — Cardinal Lawrence in that film — might just snatch a surprise win from The Brutalist’s Adrien Brody.\nThat’s my boy! Arine not fazed by son’s nude scene\nPatrick Schwarzenegger said that his family, who all went to see the first episode at the premiere in Los Angeles, were in for some surprises\nBrace yourself for male nudity galore in the new series of The White Lotus, which will start streaming from Monday.\nWe’ll see an awful lot of Arnold Schwarzenegger’s son Patrick, wearing very little, as well as newcomer Sam Nivola’s buttocks.\nThere also is a taboo-busting, full frontal glimpse of actor Jason Isaacs with his dressing gown agape, which is bound to cause a commotion.\nLast series, a scene in which actor Theo James was seen naked ignited global debate, and James clarified that he was wearing a prosthetic penis.\nIsaacs, 61, says of the flash: ‘Well I’ve done it now, so enjoy it while it’s there.’\nHe added, jokingly: ‘I didn’t know that I was naked in the thing. I don’t really remember that day at all. The truth is, the nudity wasn’t Mike (White Lotus creator Mike White). It’s in my contract. I insist on it in every show.’\nPatrick Schwarzenegger said that his family, who all went to see the first episode at the premiere in Los Angeles, were in for some surprises as the show continued (in addition to the nudity, his character has a penchant for porn).\nHe said: ‘Episode one is pretty safe. But you know, there’s some uncomfortable conversations that are a little weird to show in front of your family.\n‘I think that, yeah, episodes five and six, there’ll be some times that I take some bathroom breaks when the family watch. Or maybe I won’t watch that episode.’\nThe White Lotus is a social satire following the exploits of various employees and guests at an exclusive resort during one tumultuous week in paradise\nProud father Arnold, who first made his name in Hollywood as (shirtless) Conan The Barbarian, posted on Instagram on Tuesday: ‘I was so pumped to take a break from filming to celebrate @patrickschwarzenegger at the White Lotus Season 3 premiere.\nWhat a show! I could claim to be surprised to find out he has a nude scene, but what can I say — the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.’\nSam Nivola, son of actors Emily Mortimer and Alessandro Nivola, said of his nude scene: ‘It was my first time... and of course, that comes with a lot of fear and anxiety. I’m already an anxious person, about just acting in general. Then you have got to do it naked!\n‘It’s intense, but there’s few people that I would trust more with footage of my buttocks than Mike White. He made us feel so comfortable.’\nShare what you think\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\nBy posting your comment you agree to ourhouse rules.\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

So how it will be received by viewers is set to depend on Meghan’s charisma alone.\nThere is also no mention or sighting of the couple’s children Archie and Lilibet – although this is less of a surprise as they closely guard their offspring’s privacy.\nThe source said: ‘There is no point at which Meghan says “take 200 grams of flour” or anything like that.\n‘It’s a very magical and beautiful guide to hosting and entertaining rather than a how-to cookery show.

        "headline": "BRIAN VINER reviews I'm Still Here: Chilling reality behind the glitz of Pele's Brazil",
        "body": "ByBRIAN VINER\nPublished:00:01 GMT, 21 February 2025|Updated:01:10 GMT, 21 February 2025\n\n2\nViewcomments\n\nI’m Still Here (15, 137 mins)\nVerdict: The other side ofBrazil\nRating:\nThe first foreign-language film nominated for Best Picture at theAcademy Awardswas Jean Renoir’s masterpiece La Grande Illusion in 1938. Another 19 have followed but only one has won: Parasite in 2019.\nThere is next to no chance that the Brazilian contender I’m Still Here will follow suit in nine days’ time. If anything, the bookies have understated the 100/1 price. But it is a very good film.\nIt is set in Rio de Janeiro in 1970. Now, for those of us of a certain age who love sport, Brazil 1970 evokes only one thing: the extravagantly gifted football team that won the World Cup inMexicothat summer, inspired by magical players – above all,Pele– whose names still resound across the decades.\nBut I’m Still Here acts as a kind of rebuke to us for forgetting – or perhaps never even properly understanding – that even as Pele and his team-mates became footballing immortals, Brazil was being brutalised by a military dictatorship.\nThis film, by the eminent Brazilian director Walter Salles, sets the history books straight, or at least points us towards a much darker chapter. It tells the true story of the affluent, middle-class Paiva family (whom Salles knew, growing up in Rio), whose comfortable life was ripped apart following that ominous sound in all totalitarian countries: the knock on the door.\nUntil that point, Salles carefully builds up a sense of a gilded existence. The Paiva parents, Rubens (Selton Mello) and Eunice (Fernanda Torres), preside benignly over a joyful household. They have five bright, chatty kids, not to mention a loyal housekeeper. In some ways I was reminded of Alfonso Cuaron’s lovely 2018 film Roma, another foreign-language nominee for Best Picture at the Oscars.\nThe nearby beach symbolises the Paivas’ contentment. It is there that they play football and volleyball, and find a stray Jack Russell they are allowed to adopt.\nI’m Still Here tells the true story of the affluent, middle-class Paiva family whose comfortable life was ripped apart following that sound in all totalitarian countries: the knock on the door\nTorres gives a wonderful performance as Eunice, whose stoicism even after she and one of her daughters are carted off, whose pride in her identity and determination to protect her kids, drive the rest of the film\nThe nearby beach symbolises the Paivas’ contentment. It is there that they play football and volleyball, and find a stray Jack Russell they are allowed to adopt\nBut a cloud is encroaching on the sun. We see it in the passing trucks full of soldiers, and also, when the eldest daughter is packed off to live with family friends in London, in the suggestion that the rest of them should go, too.\nIt seems that Rubens, a former congressman, is engaged in low-level dissent against the regime. Soon, he is driven away to be interrogated.\nBehind him, unsmiling men stay in the house ‘to keep an eye’ on the family, yet genteel Eunice (who tells her children they are from ‘pest control’) does not forget her manners, and insists they sit down for lunch.\nTorres, incidentally, is also in the running for an Oscar. She is the second Brazilian to reach the Best Actress shortlist after her own mother, Fernanda Montenegro (who at the age of 95 has a small role in I’m Still Here), was honoured for the 1998 film Central Station, also directed by Salles. Which as a further aside makes them the first mother-and-daughter Best Actress nominees since Judy Garland and Liza Minnelli. That’s illustrious company.\nTorres deserves her Oscar nod. She gives a wonderful performance as Eunice, whose stoicism even after she and one of her daughters are also carted off, whose pride in her identity and determination to protect her kids, drive the rest of the film.\nThe story winds forward 25 years and then another 15, but its focus throughout is on the events of 1970. And while Salles could easily have ramped up the violence, could have turned up the emotions from a simmer to a boil, it is a more powerful and memorable picture for his restraint.\nThe Monkey (15, 98 mins)\nVerdict: Nuts\nRating:\nThere is nothing restrained about The Monkey, Osgood Perkins’s darkly comic horror film based on a short story by Stephen King. A demonic toy monkey terrorises the lives of twins Hal and Bill, one amiable, the other a bully (both played as children by Christian Convery and as grown-ups by Theo James).\nBasically, when the monkey bashes his drum it’s a cue for someone to die, and those deaths get ever more preposterously gory.\nAt times The Monkey brings to mind the TV show Six Feet Under, but that was done with infinitely more wit.\nA demonic toy monkey terrorises the lives of twins Hal and Bill, one amiable, the other a bully\nThe problem here is that the scares aren’t terribly scary and the laughs aren’t wildly funny. All that really seems to matter is the blood and quite literally the guts, as in one scene when a shopkeeper’s intestines are dragged out of him.\nSpeaking of internal bits, director Perkins is all but umbilically linked to one of the most chilling films of all time, Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho (1960), which starred his late father Anthony. He rose to the challenge of that heritage with his last film, Longlegs (2024). But The Monkey is just nuts, and not in a good way.\nSeptember Says (18, 100 mins)\nVerdict: Creepy unsettling\nRating:\nSeptember Says is a creepier film about school-age siblings, September (Pascale Kann) and July (Mia Tharia). Again, one of them is much more dominant, and again their story gets ever more grim. But it is compellingly unsettling throughout.\nFor actress Ariane Labed – whose husband, Yorgos Lanthimos, made The Favourite (2018) and Poor Things (2023), both festooned with Oscar nominations – this is a promising directorial debut.\nAll three films in cinemas now.\nSchemichel (15, 90 mins)\nRating:\nSchemichel is a must-watch for fans of Manchester United and (possibly a slightly smaller percentage of our readers) Denmark.\nEven if you have different football affiliations, though, this is a very enjoyable documentary about one of the most influential goalkeepers of recent times: the great Dane Peter Schmeichel.\nThis is a very enjoyable documentary about one of the most influential goalkeepers of recent times: the great Dane Peter Schmeichel\nHis former teammates make some entertaining contributions. Gary Neville recalls that if you made a defensive error in front of the big man, he was as unforgiving as if you’d stolen his granny’s handbag. But a more surprising revelation is that his troubled Polish father, a musician (from whom Schmeichel has inherited a talent for playing the piano, putting his huge hands to another use entirely), was fleetingly a spy, indeed a double agent.\nI am Martin Parr (12A, 68 mins)\nRating:\nAnother absorbing documentary, I Am Martin Parr sheds light on the work of one of our finest photographers, whose unerring eye for both the banalities and peculiarities of everyday British life has yielded a cherishable pictorial record of the past 50 years.\nI especially love his photograph of three nuns eating ice creams in a park, shooing away a curious swan. It’s a small work of genius.\nSchmeichel is on all digital platforms; I Am Martin Parr is in select cinemas.\nThe Banshees of Inisherin (2022)\nWill this be considered a classic a generation from now? I hope so. Martin McDonagh’s dark, offbeat comedy about two friends (Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell) who fall out in 1920s Ireland is just exquisite.\nSaturday, 9.15pm, Channel 4.\nShare what you think\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\nBy posting your comment you agree to ourhouse rules.\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

        "headline": "BRIAN VINER reviews A Real Pain: A masterpiece from the heir to Woody Allen",
        "body": "ByBRIAN VINER\nPublished:01:02 GMT, 10 January 2025|Updated:02:38 GMT, 10 January 2025\n\n12\nViewcomments\n\nVerdict: Truly wonderful\nRating:\nJesse Eisenberghas said that he was inspired to write A Real Pain after coming across an online advert promoting tours of the concentration camp Auschwitz, with lunch included.\nHe has parlayed that darkly comic irony — the unwitting but shrieking dissonance between the monumental evil and human misery implied by one word, Auschwitz, and the lush comforts of modern-day tourism — into a truly wonderful film.\nA Real Pain is uproariously funny, quietly witty, achingly sad and excruciatingly well-observed. That's quite a trick to pull off inside an hour and a half.\nEisenberg plays David, withKieran Culkin(newly anointed with aGolden Globefor his brilliant performance) as his first cousin Benji.\nNew York Jews, born just a few weeks apart, they have always been close despite the differences in their personalities, not to mention their hyphenated disorders.\nDavid, married with a son, is obsessive-compulsive, socially anxious, introspective. Benji is single, sociable and charismatic. He is also hyper-active and deeply troubled, with attention-deficit issues.\nWill Sharpe (left) and Jesse Eisenberg (right) as their characters James and David and in a scene from A Real Pain\nKieran Culkin (left) and Jesse Eisenberg (right) as their characters Benji and David in A Real Pain\nWe meet them as they prepare to leave for Poland, where they will join a 'Holocaust tour' as a way of honouring their grandmother Dory, a survivor, who has recently died.\nThey plan to peel off the tour for the last couple of days to find the house where Dory lived before she was hauled off to the camps.\nThe two contrasting personality types afford Eisenberg numerous opportunities for both poignancy and comedy, which he exploits beautifully.\nHe and Culkin, in some ways playing an even more unpredictable version of Roman Roy, his character in the TV hit Succession, are completely believable as loving cousins, although David, perennially envious of Benji's magnetism, also finds him utterly exasperating. 'I love him, I hate him, I want to kill him, I want to be him,' he tells the others in the party.\nThey have been written and cast perfectly, too. In particular, Will Sharpe (The White Lotus) is glorious as James, the kindly, non-Jewish tour leader from the north of England, upbraided by Benji in a cemetery for being too talkative.\nThat's rich, coming from him, but then Culkin nails the contradictions in Benji, blithely trampling over people's sensibilities yet with hair-trigger sensitivities of his own.\nIt is Benji alone who is discomfited by a group of 21st-century American Jews travelling first-class on a Polish train.\nHe declares that he is going to move to a standard-class compartment. 'I don't think you'll find much suffering there, either,' says one of his tour companions, wryly.\nJennifer Grey as her character Marcia in a scene from Jessie Eisenberg's film A Real Pain\nExcluding James, there are six on the tour, all Americans except for an African man, Eloge (Kurt Egyiawan), who lost relatives in the Rwanda genocide, moved to Canada and converted to Judaism.\nHe is apparently modelled on a friend of Eisenberg's, who has plundered his own life and heritage to make this film.\nIndeed, the modest house where his Polish-born great-aunt once lived is used as Grandma Dory's childhood home.\nPulling so strongly on his roots is one of many ways in which Eisenberg has become the heir to Woody Allen, both on screen as the smart, neurotic, weedy Jewish New Yorker (not much of a stretch by all accounts), and now as a writer and director.\nNot everyone will consider that to be praise, but if you cherish the best of Allen's films, the likes of Annie Hall (1977) and Hannah And Her Sisters (1986), then you will love A Real Pain.\nI treasured every one of its 90 minutes — and what a lesson, by the way, in economy of story-telling. Allen was always good at that, too.\nThis is the movie he might well wish he'd made, and maybe could have done, once, except that it has oodles more heart and tenderness than most of his. It's a small masterpiece.\nVerdict: Clever and racy\nRating:\nThe same claim cannot be made for Babygirl, and it's not without some narrative silliness, but on the whole it's a clever, racy, psychosexual thriller starring Nicole Kidman as Romy, a corporate hotshot who seems to be happily married to Jacob (Antonio Banderas), a theatre director, but then falls, heavily, for one of her company's new intake of interns, the dishy, ultra-confident Samuel (Harris Dickinson).\nWriter-director Halina Reijn's film is not just the story of an illicit office affair across the age divide, however.

        "body": "ByBRIAN VINER\nPublished:01:02 GMT, 10 January 2025|Updated:02:38 GMT, 10 January 2025\n\n12\nViewcomments\n\nVerdict: Truly wonderful\nRating:\nJesse Eisenberghas said that he was inspired to write A Real Pain after coming across an online advert promoting tours of the concentration camp Auschwitz, with lunch included.\nHe has parlayed that darkly comic irony — the unwitting but shrieking dissonance between the monumental evil and human misery implied by one word, Auschwitz, and the lush comforts of modern-day tourism — into a truly wonderful film.\nA Real Pain is uproariously funny, quietly witty, achingly sad and excruciatingly well-observed. That's quite a trick to pull off inside an hour and a half.\nEisenberg plays David, withKieran Culkin(newly anointed with aGolden Globefor his brilliant performance) as his first cousin Benji.\nNew York Jews, born just a few weeks apart, they have always been close despite the differences in their personalities, not to mention their hyphenated disorders.\nDavid, married with a son, is obsessive-compulsive, socially anxious, introspective. Benji is single, sociable and charismatic. He is also hyper-active and deeply troubled, with attention-deficit issues.\nWill Sharpe (left) and Jesse Eisenberg (right) as their characters James and David and in a scene from A Real Pain\nKieran Culkin (left) and Jesse Eisenberg (right) as their characters Benji and David in A Real Pain\nWe meet them as they prepare to leave for Poland, where they will join a 'Holocaust tour' as a way of honouring their grandmother Dory, a survivor, who has recently died.\nThey plan to peel off the tour for the last couple of days to find the house where Dory lived before she was hauled off to the camps.\nThe two contrasting personality types afford Eisenberg numerous opportunities for both poignancy and comedy, which he exploits beautifully.\nHe and Culkin, in some ways playing an even more unpredictable version of Roman Roy, his character in the TV hit Succession, are completely believable as loving cousins, although David, perennially envious of Benji's magnetism, also finds him utterly exasperating. 'I love him, I hate him, I want to kill him, I want to be him,' he tells the others in the party.\nThey have been written and cast perfectly, too. In particular, Will Sharpe (The White Lotus) is glorious as James, the kindly, non-Jewish tour leader from the north of England, upbraided by Benji in a cemetery for being too talkative.\nThat's rich, coming from him, but then Culkin nails the contradictions in Benji, blithely trampling over people's sensibilities yet with hair-trigger sensitivities of his own.\nIt is Benji alone who is discomfited by a group of 21st-century American Jews travelling first-class on a Polish train.\nHe declares that he is going to move to a standard-class compartment. 'I don't think you'll find much suffering there, either,' says one of his tour companions, wryly.\nJennifer Grey as her character Marcia in a scene from Jessie Eisenberg's film A Real Pain\nExcluding James, there are six on the tour, all Americans except for an African man, Eloge (Kurt Egyiawan), who lost relatives in the Rwanda genocide, moved to Canada and converted to Judaism.\nHe is apparently modelled on a friend of Eisenberg's, who has plundered his own life and heritage to make this film.\nIndeed, the modest house where his Polish-born great-aunt once lived is used as Grandma Dory's childhood home.\nPulling so strongly on his roots is one of many ways in which Eisenberg has become the heir to Woody Allen, both on screen as the smart, neurotic, weedy Jewish New Yorker (not much of a stretch by all accounts), and now as a writer and director.\nNot everyone will consider that to be praise, but if you cherish the best of Allen's films, the likes of Annie Hall (1977) and Hannah And Her Sisters (1986), then you will love A Real Pain.\nI treasured every one of its 90 minutes — and what a lesson, by the way, in economy of story-telling. Allen was always good at that, too.\nThis is the movie he might well wish he'd made, and maybe could have done, once, except that it has oodles more heart and tenderness than most of his. It's a small masterpiece.\nVerdict: Clever and racy\nRating:\nThe same claim cannot be made for Babygirl, and it's not without some narrative silliness, but on the whole it's a clever, racy, psychosexual thriller starring Nicole Kidman as Romy, a corporate hotshot who seems to be happily married to Jacob (Antonio Banderas), a theatre director, but then falls, heavily, for one of her company's new intake of interns, the dishy, ultra-confident Samuel (Harris Dickinson).\nWriter-director Halina Reijn's film is not just the story of an illicit office affair across the age divide, however. Far more interestingly, it's also about power and workplace politics.\nNicole Kidman as Romy, a corporate hotshot who seems to be happily married to Jacob (Antonio Banderas)\nBut then falls, heavily, for one of her company's new intake of interns, the dishy, ultra-confident Samuel (Harris Dickinson)\nNicole Kidman as Romy and Harris Dickenson as Samuel during a racy scene in Babygirl\nSamuel senses that Romy, whose job is telling others what to do, has a kinky yearning to be the one jumping to orders.\nSo the CEO and the intern switch roles; the boss becomes the bossed.\nBoth leads are excellent, especially Kidman.

        "body": "ByBRIAN VINER FOR THE DAILY MAIL\nPublished:08:56 GMT, 12 February 2025|Updated:09:19 GMT, 12 February 2025\n\n32\nViewcomments\n\nBridget Jones: Mad About The Boy (15, 125 minutes)\nVerdict: A tearjerker that also makes you laugh out loud.\nRating:\nFOUR STARS\nShe’s back - and while some people might wish she wasn’t, because after all she’s not everyone’s glass of Chardonnay - she’s back with bells on.\nThe fourth Bridget Jones film is the best since the 2001 original, and aptly enough is the most grown-up of the quartet, exploring bereavement and grief but never at the expense of wit and charm.\nIt explores plenty of other stuff, too, not least romance across a mighty age divide.\nFor decades, mainstream cinema only tackled that in terms of older men and sirens half their age.\nNow, post-MeToo, it seems to be the other way round:Nicole KidmanandAnne Hathawayhave both recently played women who fall into bed with chaps young enough to be their sons, and here it’s the turn of 55-year-oldRenee Zellweger.\nThis film’s other title character is played byLeo Woodall, star of TV dramas TheWhite Lotusand One Day. He is 28.\nShe’s back - and while some people might wish she wasn’t, because after all she’s not everyone’s glass of Chardonnay - Bridget Jones is back with bells on\nZellweger gives her usual thunderously mannered performance as Bridget. But again she pulls off the trick, somehow, of making it engaging.\nThe Olympian haplessness, the daft pratfalls, the comedy walk that is all but a waddle, they’re all firmly in place. But she is still emblematic of many aspects of womanhood.\nZellweger’s skill, and that of writers Helen Fielding, Dan Mazer and Abi Morgan, is in moving Bridget (who incidentally is meant to be 47, not 55) credibly on to a new phase of life.\nShe is a widowed mother of two now.\nIt is four years since her husband Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) - a stiff human-rights lawyer strongly rumoured to be based on a certain Keir Starmer (though Fielding, Bridget’s creator, remains mischievously evasive on the subject) - died on a humanitarian mission in the Sudan.\nWe see him sporadically, both in flashback and as a kind of ghost, in his family’s imagination.\nBridget and her primary school-age kids, Billy and Mabel, live amid chaotic middle-class clutter in affluent Hampstead, north London.\nThe comedian Arnold Brown used to have a great routine about Hampstead’s ineffable middle-classness, suggesting that even people who live in council houses there have council houses in Wales they go to at the weekends.\nThis film’s other title character is played by Leo Woodall, star of TV dramas The White Lotus and One Day. He is 28 and plays dishy young park-keeper Roxster\nThis film mines the same rich seam, relentlessly satirising the complacency of the area’s yummy mummies and their high-earning husbands.\nIt’s a bit like shooting fish, or maybe taramasalata, in a barrel. But it is no less funny for it.\nThere is no man in Bridget’s life. Her old flame, the incorrigibly roguish Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant on fine form), is still around, but she’s much too old for him now. She has become, he tells her, ‘effectively a nun’.\nHer Netflix password is ‘allbymyself47’, despite her presence on the dating site Tinder, on which her TV presenter friend (Sarah Solemani) has set her up as ‘tragic widow needs sexual awakening’.\nBut then, on Hampstead Heath, she meets a dishy young park-keeper called Roxster (Woodall), and soon, to the delighted bemusement of her old pals, they are an item.\nThere are several uproarious scenes, one of which sees Roxster stripping down to his underwear to rescue a dog from a swimming-pool.\nHis heroics are accompanied by Dinah Washington’s song Mad About The Boy while Bridget’s middle-aged friends look on, tongues practically hanging out.\nI took my grown-up daughter (who’d barely started school when the first film, Bridget Jones’ Diary, came out) to last month’s world premiere, and she had to suppress hysterical laughter more than once, especially when a lip-serum injection goes badly, hilariously wrong.\nHer old flame, the incorrigibly roguish Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant on fine form), is still around, but she’s much too old for him now. She has become, he tells her, ‘effectively a nun’\nBut director Michael Morris (whose experience is mainly in television, on the majestic Better Call Saul among other hit shows) ensures that these comic set pieces do not interrupt the narrative flow, which also has Bridget apprehensively going back to work as a TV producer.\nNor does the comedy stop us believing in the characters, who include an earnest but kindly science teacher sweetly played by Chiwetel Ejiofor\nEven more importantly, the poignancy of two young children coming to terms with their father’s death feels real. Bridget Jones: Mad About The Boy is that rare thing, a tearjerker that also makes you laugh out loud.\nBridget Jones: Mad About The Boy opens on Thursday across the UK\nShare what you think\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\nBy posting your comment you agree to ourhouse rules.\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

        "headline": "BRIAN VINER reviews September 5: Drama behind first ever live broadcast of a terror attack",
        "body": "ByBRIAN VINER FOR THE DAILY MAIL\nPublished:00:51 GMT, 7 February 2025|Updated:01:50 GMT, 7 February 2025\n\n1\nViewcomments\n\nVerdict: Taut thriller\nRating:\nFollowing the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, President Franklin D. Roosevelt called December 7, 1941 ‘a date which will live in infamy’.\nTragically, the calendar now has quite a few more of them, including the one chronicled in an excellent documentary-style thriller, simply titled September 5.\nThat was the Tuesday during the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich when 11 members of theIsraeliteam ended up dead, after being taken hostage by Palestinian ‘Black September’ terrorists who threatened to kill one every hour unless their demands (of a wholesale release of prisoners from Israeli prisons) were met.\nThe story has been told before, both as documentary (Kevin Macdonald’s brilliant 1999 Oscar-winner One Day In September) and as drama (Steven Spielberg’s disappointingly turgid 2005 film Munich, which focused more on the Israeli mission, over the ensuing months and years, to assassinate all those responsible for the massacre).\nThis time, director and co-writer Tim Fehlbaum looks at the shocking events of that day 53 years ago entirely from the perspective of the US television network ABC, whose team was in WestGermanyto deliver a purely sporting narrative yet found itself at the heart of the first terrorist outrage to be broadcast live across the world. ABC’s transmission was apparently seen by more people than, three years earlier, had watched Neil Armstrong walk on the moon.\nWith a busy hand-held camera and a grainy texture to the pictures, as well as the insertion of actual archive footage, Fehlbaum very cleverly evokes both the chaos of the hostage crisis and the technological primitivism, compared with now, of the era.\nTim Fehlbaum looks at the shocking events of that day 53 years ago entirely from the perspective of the US television network ABC\nWith a busy hand-held camera and a grainy texture to the pictures, as well as the insertion of actual archive footage, Fehlbaum very cleverly evokes both the chaos of the hostage crisis and the technological primitivism, compared with now, of the era\nThe casting is spot-on. John Magaro is terrific as nervy but resourceful producer Geoffrey Mason, with Peter Sarsgaard as classy as ever as taciturn ABC Sports supremo Roone Arledge (pictured) determined to keep the broadcast from being commandeered by the network’s News division\nWe see history being recorded from a desperately cramped studio in which the air-conditioning has failed, with sweat pouring off everyone, while screen graphics are painstakingly assembled by hand.\nThe casting is spot-on. John Magaro is terrific as nervy but resourceful producer Geoffrey Mason, with Peter Sarsgaard as classy as ever as taciturn ABC Sports supremo Roone Arledge, determined to keep the broadcast from being commandeered by the network’s News division.\nBen Chaplin plays ABC’s head of operations Marvin Bader, with German actress Leonie Benesch as a fictionalised character but a useful one: a production assistant roped in as an interpreter.\nWith impressive sleight of hand, Fehlbaum makes it look as if the backroom team are in dialogue with the real-life presenters Jim McKay and Peter Jennings.\nEven though we know how the story ends, the film, at a compellingly taut 95 minutes, is heart-thumpingly tense throughout and a deserving Oscar nominee for Best Original Screenplay.\nThere’s a startling moment when the ABC crew realise that the terrorists, too, are watching their live pictures of German police moving in on the apartment in the Olympic Village where the athletes are being held. And it’s all so authentic that we later feel their exhilaration when word arrives that the hostages, after being transported to a nearby airfield, have all been saved. Alas, it is not so.\nThe modern-day parallels with all this are stark, of course. But Fehlbaum and his co-writer Moritz Binder wisely make no attempt to force them on the audience. Indeed, at the start of the film, before the alarming sound of distant gunfire changes everything, we hear Arledge insisting that the painful spectre of the Holocaust should be raised in an interview with America’s multiple gold-medallist, Jewish swimmer Mark Spitz. So, if anything, we are encouraged to do the same as the protagonists, and contemplate not the future but the past. September 5 is a very skilled and concise piece of storytelling.\nVerdict: Modern-day Irish 'Western'\nRating:\nBring Them Down sees neighbouring sheep farmers are locked in a feud\nBring Them Down is another thriller, also nicely done, yet its setting could hardly be more different than that of September 5. In the beautiful west of Ireland, two neighbouring sheep farmers are locked in a feud, which intensifies when one starts mutilating the other’s rams.\nTo ramp up emotions further, one farmer is an incomer from the north, married to the ex-girlfriend of the other, a Gaelic-speaking local.\nTheir growing enmity builds to a wildly overwrought ending, but this is nevertheless a highly promising debut by first-time director Christopher Andrews, a kind of Irish-accented Western enhanced by a fine cast including Christopher Abbott, Colm Meaney and Barry Keoghan – in an ‘eejit’ role strikingly similar to the one he played so marvellously in The Banshees Of Inisherin (2022).\nVerdict: Stairway to fan heaven\nRating:\nRock God: Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page pictured performing on stage in 1975\nSpeaking of banshees, not everyone loves the music of Led Zeppelin. But if you do then Bernard MacMahon’s documentary Becoming Led Zeppelin is a must-see. Meticulously, in great detail and at great length, it charts the careers of each of the mighty rock band’s original members, telling some truly fabulous stories along the way. And did you know that in his days as a little-known session musician, virtuoso guitarist Jimmy Page played on Shirley Bassey’s recording of a certain James Bond theme song? I’ll give you a clue. This is pub-quiz gold.\nAll films are in cinemas now.\nLove Hurts (15, 83mins)\nRating:\nKe Huy Quan, left, and Ariana DeBose in a scene from Love Hurts\nAT THE tender age of 53, former child starturned Oscar-winning comeback kidKe Huy Quan (Everything Everywhere All At Once) finally lands his first major leading man role in Love Hurts. Shame, then, that it’s so bad.\nQuan is a mild-mannered real estate agent whose secret past – as a hitman - is revealed after a partner-in-crime he’d left for dead (Ariana DeBose) reappears on Valentine’s Day.\nA misjudged blend of romance, cookie cutter wisdom (‘hiding isn’t living!’), uninspired comedy, poorly edited martial arts, and jarringly graphic violence, the only thing to love is a rather sweet Goonies reunion between Quan and his buddy, Sean Astin.\nRating:\n\nThis film sees half man/half mutt police officer hero on a mission to capture ‘the world’s most evilest cat’\nThe fact that Dog Man is brought to you ‘from the creators of Captain Underpants’ gives you the flavour of this frenzied cartoon silliness.\nA lavish, big-screen adaptation of Dav Pilkey’s bestselling comic books, this spin-off sees our half man/half mutt police officer hero on a skimpily narrated mission to capture ‘the world’s most evilest cat’ (voiced by Pete Davidson) while bonding with a very cute kitten (Lucas Hopkins Calderon).\nPleasingly playful and heartfelt, with distinctive crayon-style animation, the quickfire gags throw adults some bones — but the neuron-frazzling mayhem is aimed squarely at kids.

You might even prefer to do something that sounds more fun, like staying at home to clean the oven.\nBut as ever with Leigh's best work – and this certainly qualifies – Hard Truths pulsates with humanity. There is warmth and humour rubbing shoulders with the wretchedness.\nMike Leigh's Hard Truths stars Marianne Jean-Baptiste as Pansy, a deeply unhappy, acid-tongued woman in the grip of what appears to be severe depression\nLeigh's mighty reputation as a filmmaker was built by gritty contemporary realism, and after a pair of pictures of contrasting merit set in the 19th century  he returns to more familiar pastures with Hard Truths\nMoreover, it is enlightening. We have an acquaintance very much like Pansy, and always regarded her as thoroughly unpleasant, one of life's irredeemable misanthropes. It hadn't occurred to me until watching this absorbing film that she is more than likely horribly depressed.\nPansy lives in a respectable suburban semi, somewhere in London, with her husband Curtley (David Webber), a plumber, and their aimless, overweight only son, 22-year-old Moses (Tuwaine Barrett).\nShe is permanently furious with them and with the world at large. They in turn are incommunicative and taciturn. Whether their sullen introversion is a cause or a consequence of her misery, manifest also in anxiety and phobias, is never clear. Perhaps a little of both.\nThe film, crafted in Leigh's favoured way of intensive workshopping, with the actors encouraged to build the characters themselves, lacks anything that resembles an actual plot.\nRather, it is a gripping, episodic study of an extended black British family, which sometimes switches its focus to Pansy's hairdresser sister Chantelle, as sunny as Pansy is sorrowful and beautifully played by Michele Austin (who was also in Secrets & Lies), and her two bright, highly engaging grown-up daughters, Kayla (Ani Nelson) and Aleisha (Sophia Brown).\nIt is a gripping, episodic study of an extended black British family, which sometimes switches its focus to Pansy's hairdresser sister Chantelle (left), as sunny as Pansy is sorrowful and beautifully played by Michele Austin\nOccasionally, we get clues to Pansy's past. On Mother's Day, very grudgingly, she goes with Chantelle to visit their mother's grave, where old resentments spill out and their conversation sheds further light on her gloomy marriage. But the film is at its best (and oddly, funniest) when the savagely witty Pansy is out and about venting her splenetic rage: visiting the doctor, the dentist, in a check-out queue at the supermarket, in a car park.\nI've seen Hard Truths twice now, and the first time I wondered whether Jean-Baptiste maybe overdoes it a little.\nBut on second viewing, and with that acquaintance of ours in mind, I can appreciate what a superb performance it is, at the heart of a truly excellent film. Leigh will turn 82 next month. Happily, it is not too old for a blistering return to form.\nSaturday Night (15, 109mins)\nVerdict: Feverish drama\nRating:\nChevy Chase turns 82 this year, too. Of the main originals who in October 1975 took part in the opening broadcast of NBC's comedy show Saturday Night, later re-titledSaturday Night Live, he is one of the few still alive.\nSo it must have been a blow when Chase reportedly told Jason Reitman, whose movie Saturday Night fictionalises the frantic lead-up to that inaugural show, that he should be 'embarrassed' by it.\nJK Simmons as Milton Berle from Saturday Night\nThe stars of Saturday Night from left to right: Kim Matula, as Jane Curtain, Emily Fairn, as Laraine Newman, Gabriel La Belle, as Lorne Michaels, Rachel Sennott, as Rosie Shuster, and Matt Wood, as John Belushi\nWell, I enjoyed it. Unfolding more or less in real time, the film chronicles the hours before transmission, with chaos all around, lights crashing down, a neurotic Billy Crystal (Nicholas Podany) fretting about his material, a fight between Chase (Cory Michael Smith) and co-star John Belushi (Matt Wood), and producer Lorne Michaels (Gabriel LaBelle) wondering if he'll have a career left by Sunday morning.\nWith SNL, as it is now known, having become a revered institution, Reitman and co-writer Gil Kenan present that first show as a seismic moment in US TV history, using sneering old-timers like Johnny Carson (Jeff Witzke) and Milton Berle (played by JK Simmons as a sex predator) to emphasise an evolutionary shift.\nMaybe you couldn't give any more hoots about this than a US audience might about the first night of The Two Ronnies, which is fair enough. But for anyone with more than a passing interest in SNL, it's worth a look.\nThe Apartment (PG, 125mins)\nRating:\nThe 1960 classic The Apartment is getting a welcome re-release to mark the centenary of Jack Lemmon's birth next week, and if you're familiar with the film you will enjoy the curious factual nugget that Lemmon was born in a lift.\nFor it is a lift (or if we must, an elevator) attendant, Fran Kubelik, played by Shirley MacLaine at her loveliest, for whom Lemmon's character falls, hard, in Billy Wilder's glorious romantic comedy. Lemmon plays\nJack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine in the 1960 classic The Apartment which is s getting a welcome re-release to mark the centenary of Lemmon's birth next week\nCC Baxter, an insurance company clerk who curries favour with senior colleagues by letting them use his apartment in midtown Manhattan for sexual 'assignations'.\nBut a complex situation becomes intolerable when he finds that his boss, Mr Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray), is having an affair with none other than sweet Miss Kubelik.\nThe screenplay by Wilder and IAL Diamond is as fresh and sparkling now as it ever was, so if you've never seen The Apartment on a big screen – or perish the thought, at all – treat yourself. It's an absolute joy.\nCompanion (15, 97mins)\nRating:\nJack Quaid and Sophie Thatcher in Companion . It starts like a romantic comedy but it quickly mutates into a combination of thriller, horror and sci-fi, skilfully handled by writer-director Drew Hancock\nCompanion starts like a romantic comedy, too, as Iris (Sophie Thatcher) and Josh (Jack Quaid) meet over some falling oranges in a supermarket aisle. Indeed, Quaid seems to have his mother Meg Ryan's gift for rom-com.\nBut once the couple arrive at a remote lake house owned by a Russian tycoon (Rupert Friend), it emerges that Iris is a 'companion robot', bought by Josh mainly for sexual purposes.\nFrom there the film quickly mutates into a combination of thriller, horror and sci-fi, skilfully handled by writer-director Drew Hancock.\nIts twists and turns would have seemed outlandish not many years ago. Now, in this AI age, it could almost be a documentary.\nAll films are in cinemas now.\nShare what you think\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\nBy posting your comment you agree to ourhouse rules.\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

It was a day that would carve itself into the collective memory of the Bengali people—a day when thelanguage movementclaimed its sacred place in history, and shaped the identity of the country, as a nation.\nIt was in the shadow of that fateful day that legendary lyricist and poet Abdul Gaffar Choudhury, then a young student and translator, found himself in the hospital, stepping carefully over the bodies of the wounded, as the echo of gunfire was still ringing in his ears. The scene before him was unimaginable: in the sterile quiet of the Dhaka Medical College outpatient ward, the lifeless body of Rafiq Uddin Ahmed lay sprawled on the cold floor, a symbol of the unyielding spirit extinguished in the struggle for something as simple and as profound as words of a certain language.\nIn that haunting moment, Abdul Gaffar Choudhury was struck by a sorrow so deep it seemed to bleed from his very bones. Looking at the martyr, he felt an inexplicable connection—Rafiq, though a stranger, was his brother, his kin, someone whose sacrifice transcended the individual and became the essence of a cause. It was in this gut-wrenching grief that the first two lines of what would become an anthem of the movement rose within him, words as raw as the blood that soaked the ground outside:\n\"Amar bhaiyer rokto rongano Ekushey February, ami ki bhulite pari?\"\nThe weight of the tragedy settled in Choudhury's heart, but so did a fire—an urgency to immortalise the day, to give voice to the bloodshed, the tears, the unwavering demand for justice. Yet, as he shared these lines with his friend Syed Ahmad Hossain, the poet was reluctant to let the words\nescape too quickly. It was not the kind of poem that could be written casually, standing on a crowded street corner. But Hossain's persistence was relentless, urging him to capture the poem before it slipped away like so many fleeting thoughts.\nChoudhury, in the chaotic aftermath of the protests and amid the uncertainty of curfews and shutdowns, found himself on a journey through the alleys of Dhaka, desperately clutching his words. In the solitude of his temporary residence, the poem began to take shape. The verses seeped out, a testament to the violence and beauty of a people united by language, a people whose loss would never be forgotten.\nThough the poem was still not finished, it was shared, quietly at first, with a handful of students, distributed in leaflets that captured the anger and sorrow of a nation in mourning. The words spread like wildfire through the city, rising against the heavy hand of oppression.\nAs the song found its voice, it was embraced by the people as something more than just a memorial—it became the pulse of a revolution. The iconic tune composed by Altaf Mahmud, and later immortalised in films and performances, carried the weight of those who had given everything.\nIn 2006, BBC Bangla ranked it as the third greatest Bengali song of all time, a recognition of its earnest impact on the Bengali identity.\nThrough the years, the poem's legacy has only deepened, transcending generations and borders, carried in translations, and echoed in the hearts of those who hear it, no matter where they are in the world.\nIn this simple yet profound song, the words of Abdul Gaffar Choudhury continue to remind us: Can we ever forget?\nThis article is based on a piece originally written by Ahmad Istiak and published in The Daily Star on February 21, 2023.\nOn this very day on February 21, 1952, the streets of Dhaka became a battlefield, soaked with the blood of young martyrs, who stood resolute in the face of oppressive authority, demanding the right to speak their mother tongue, Bangla.

After the play, singers such as Bijon Mistry, Priyanka Bhattacharya, and Mridula Samaddar graced the stage with soulful renditions of Nazrul's iconic songs.\nThe evening also featured a powerful poetry recital by Bhaskar Bandyopadhyay, who recited some of Nazrul's most beloved poems.

They highlighted how Nazrul's message of secularism, social justice, and equality remains vital in today's context.\nThe festival commenced on Monday with an opening ceremony featuring speeches by BNSS President Yakub Ali Khan and prominent scholar Mofidul Hoque. Celebrated Nazrul Sangeet artistes like Abhijit Kundu, Priyanka Gop, Monish Sarkar, Moumita Haque, and Mohit Khan delivered heartfelt performances of Nazrul's timeless compositions. The festival's opening was further enriched by a dance presentation titled \"Jage Jyotirmoy\" performed by Dhriti Nartanalay and choreographed by Warda Rihab.\nThis year's Nazrul Utsav was not only a tribute to the poet but also a vibrant reminder of his relevance in modern times, as his works continue to inspire and resonate with the spirit of unity, equality, and resilience.\nThe two-day Nazrul Utsav 2025 commemorating the legacy of Bangladesh's national poet Kazi Nazrul Islam came to a close yesterday, leaving audiences captivated by the diverse range of performances.

The play will be staged daily at 7pm, with additional shows on February 28 and March 1, at 5:00pm and 7:30pm, respectively.\nThis production marks the centenary of the play's original performance, and it serves as both a tribute to Tagore's theatrical genius and a reimagining of his vision for contemporary audiences. Tagore's admiration for Western theatre in his youth was well-documented, and \"Raktakarabi\" itself is a blend of that influence and his deep-seated passion for indigenous theatrical forms.\nIn his directorial approach, Tanvir Nahid Khan draws from Tagore's reflections on minimalism and realism, as seen in his writings on stagecraft, notably in works like \"Pather Sanchay\" and \"Rangmanch\".\nIn staging \"Raktakarabi\", the director has significantly emphasised the play's original design: sparse, almost barren sets that foster an intimate actor-audience relationship.\nThe result is a production that invites its viewers into the heart of the drama, rather than distancing them with grandeur or spectacle. His approach aligns with Tagore's belief in the transformative power of simplicity, creating an environment where the raw emotions of the characters take centre stage.\nThis return of \"Raktakarabi\" is not just an artistic endeavour; it is a timely, politically charged re-engagement of the play's central themes. Tagore's exploration of human greed, the dehumanisation of workers, and the struggle for justice are as relevant today as it was a century ago. Set in the mythical city of Yakshapuri, where a tyrannical king exploits his people to mine gold, the play's depiction of a society driven by economic greed, where workers are reduced to mere cogs in a machine, speaks to ongoing struggles for equity and dignity. As the city's workers, trapped in their labor, resist the king's oppression, \"Raktakarabi\" became a universal tale of rebellion—against both social structures and human nature.\nTanvir Nahid Khan's production also brings into focus Tagore's unique take on love and beauty in the face of oppression. Nandini, the play's central figure, embodies the forces of love, freedom, and beauty, while Ranjan, her lover, represents the power of defiance. Their tragic relationship serves as the emotional and moral core of the play. As the workers of Yakshapuri fight for a life beyond the oppressive grip of the king's greed, their desires for freedom, love, and beauty illuminate the stark contrast between the industrialised world and human yearning.\nThis production of \"Raktakarabi\" also holds a special significance in the context of Bangladesh's political climate. In the wake of mass movements for democratic reforms and social justice, the play's call for political transformation resonates with current aspirations for a fairer, more just society. The production offers more than just an artistic performance; it is a reflection on the nation's political landscape, where the struggle for a democratic state mirrors the defiance against the forces of exploitation seen in the play.\nRabindranath Tagore's legendary \"Raktakarabi\", a play that has shaped the Indian subcontinent's theatrical tradition, is set to make a grand return to the stage at Dhaka University.\nA talented ensemble of third-year students from the Department of Theatre and Performance Studies will bring the iconic production to life from February 24 to March 1, at the Natmandal Auditorium, under the direction of Assistant Professor Tanvir Nahid Khan.

        "headline": "Dighi responds to director’s allegation of 'unprofessionalism'",
        "body": "‘What a song!’: Arijit Singh praises Angel Noor’s ‘Jodi Abar’\nWhy studying abroad is becoming harder for Bangladeshi students\nJaishankar’s remarks on Bangladesh: A deeper understanding is necessary\nScuffle mars launch of new student org\nEarlier this year, Prarthana Fardin Dighi was announced as the lead actress for the film \"Tagar\", a project that generated significant buzz with its initial teaser, featuring the actress. She was praised for her appearance and expressions. However, as the filming dates approached, unexpected news surfaced—Dighi was dropped from the film, and popular actress Puja Chery replaced her. Director Aalok Hasan cited \"unprofessional behaviour\" as the reason for Dighi's removal.\nSpeaking to Prothom Alo yesterday, Aalok Hasan revealed that the shooting for \"Tagar\" had commenced that very day at Chittagong's BTCL Colony, with lead actors Ador Azad and Puja Chery among those present. Initially, Dighi was also supposed to join the shoot, but due to her dismissal, that did not happen.\nWhen asked about the claim of unprofessional behaviour, Dighi shared her side of the story with Prothom Alo yesterday afternoon. Dighi expressed her disagreement with the accusation, stating, \"I completely disagree with the claim that I've behaved unprofessionally.\"\nShe referenced her recent appearance in the teaser for \"Jongli\", stating, \"If you watch the teaser for 'Jongli', you'll see proof that I am anything but unprofessional. In the teaser, I was filmed from an incredibly unflattering angle. If I were unprofessional, I would have never allowed such a scene to be filmed in the first place. It's true that not everyone will find me to be a perfect fit—perhaps the director felt that way—but that doesn't make his accusation valid.\"\nDighi remained calm about being dropped from \"Tagar\". \"I find this situation quite normal,\" she said. \"Actors being replaced happens in Bollywood and other industries all the time. I don't have any personal issues with it. If the director feels that I don't fit a role, he has the freedom to replace me. There was no issue from my end, and there still isn't.\"\n\"I've worked with many others, and I've never faced an accusation of being termed unprofessional. Let those I've worked with be the judge of my professionalism. Renowned filmmaker Shyam Benegal has worked with me, and I've never heard such a complaint. This is the first time someone has said this about me,\" she added.\nReflecting on the situation, Dighi noted, \"I don't want to take a dig at the director. I could have easily said something like, 'I don't agree with you, why would you say that?' But I believe taking a shot at him would only make the issue bigger. I'm staying quiet for now. While I don't accept his accusation, I also respect his decision. I've made sure not to do or say anything that would be disrespectful to him or put me in a bad light. He has shared his point of view, and I don't think I need to defend myself further. My work will speak for itself. Those who have worked with me know what I'm like.\"\nEarlier, at one point, Dighi spent some time in the United States, which reportedly created a communication gap between her and the production team. Addressing this, Dighi explained, \"While I was in the US, there might have been some difficulty maintaining communication due to the time difference. All in all, the director may have found the situation challenging. Later, he informed me that he no longer wanted to work with me on this project, and I didn't argue.\"\nEven though Dighi will not be part of \"Tagar\", she expressed her best wishes for the film and its team. \"The announcement poster generated a lot of excitement, and many people appreciated it. I've been associated with this project for a good while, and of course, it feels a little sad for me to not be a part of it now. But from the bottom of my heart, I want their work to succeed. I know the story and the character well, and even though I'm not in the role anymore, I can say that it's a strong story with great casting. I hope no controversy tarnishes the beauty of the project.\"\nEarlier this year, Prarthana Fardin Dighi was announced as the lead actress for the film \"Tagar\", a project that generated significant buzz with its initial teaser, featuring the actress. She was praised for her appearance and expressions. However, as the filming dates approached, unexpected news surfaced—Dighi was dropped from the film, and popular actress Puja Chery replaced her. Director Aalok Hasan cited \"unprofessional behaviour\" as the reason for Dighi's removal.\nSpeaking to Prothom Alo yesterday, Aalok Hasan revealed that the shooting for \"Tagar\" had commenced that very day at Chittagong's BTCL Colony, with lead actors Ador Azad and Puja Chery among those present. Initially, Dighi was also supposed to join the shoot, but due to her dismissal, that did not happen.\nWhen asked about the claim of unprofessional behaviour, Dighi shared her side of the story with Prothom Alo yesterday afternoon. Dighi expressed her disagreement with the accusation, stating, \"I completely disagree with the claim that I've behaved unprofessionally.\"\nShe referenced her recent appearance in the teaser for \"Jongli\", stating, \"If you watch the teaser for 'Jongli', you'll see proof that I am anything but unprofessional. In the teaser, I was filmed from an incredibly unflattering angle. If I were unprofessional, I would have never allowed such a scene to be filmed in the first place. It's true that not everyone will find me to be a perfect fit—perhaps the director felt that way—but that doesn't make his accusation valid.\"\nDighi remained calm about being dropped from \"Tagar\". \"I find this situation quite normal,\" she said. \"Actors being replaced happens in Bollywood and other industries all the time. I don't have any personal issues with it. If the director feels that I don't fit a role, he has the freedom to replace me. There was no issue from my end, and there still isn't.\"\n\"I've worked with many others, and I've never faced an accusation of being termed unprofessional. Let those I've worked with be the judge of my professionalism. Renowned filmmaker Shyam Benegal has worked with me, and I've never heard such a complaint. This is the first time someone has said this about me,\" she added.\nReflecting on the situation, Dighi noted, \"I don't want to take a dig at the director. I could have easily said something like, 'I don't agree with you, why would you say that?' But I believe taking a shot at him would only make the issue bigger. I'm staying quiet for now. While I don't accept his accusation, I also respect his decision. I've made sure not to do or say anything that would be disrespectful to him or put me in a bad light. He has shared his point of view, and I don't think I need to defend myself further. My work will speak for itself. Those who have worked with me know what I'm like.\"\nEarlier, at one point, Dighi spent some time in the United States, which reportedly created a communication gap between her and the production team. Addressing this, Dighi explained, \"While I was in the US, there might have been some difficulty maintaining communication due to the time difference. All in all, the director may have found the situation challenging. Later, he informed me that he no longer wanted to work with me on this project, and I didn't argue.\"\nEven though Dighi will not be part of \"Tagar\", she expressed her best wishes for the film and its team. \"The announcement poster generated a lot of excitement, and many people appreciated it. I've been associated with this project for a good while, and of course, it feels a little sad for me to not be a part of it now. But from the bottom of my heart, I want their work to succeed.

She is a painter, an actress, and a producer who yearns to play rebellious characters on-screen. Although the award-winning film was finished years ago and was initially set to release in 2020, the global pandemic delayed its premiere in the country. It was finally released in Bangladeshi halls yesterday.\n\"Rickshaw Girl\" was originally made to cater to international audiences—so the characters had to speak in English, which came pretty easily for Novera.\n\"I was raised in Dhaka, so I can speak all kinds of Bangla—from posh to street,\" said the actress, who had dropped by for an interview with The Daily Star. \"The challenge, however, was toning down my American accent. Having spent some time in America, the difficulty arose when I had to speak English throughout the film in a way that felt natural to native English speakers while also making it sound like English spoken by a Bangladeshi.\"\nTo achieve this, Novera listened to 1970s footage to capture the unique Bangladeshi accent of that time, which isn't fully British or American. \"I further added a hint of street lingo to it, as well.\"\nIt's rare to catch a glimpse of female rickshaw pullers in the streets of Dhaka, and so when we asked Novera whether she could refer to one while shooting. She shared the inspiring story of Shimu apa, a female rickshaw puller who lives on her own.\n\"Believe it or not, there are female rickshaw pullers in Dhaka, particularly on the outskirts of the city. I spent a day with Shimu apa, following her through her daily routine and strolling around her neighbourhood as though she owned it. Watching her confidently navigate her world really inspired me and gave me the strength to play Naima,\" revealed the artiste.\nNovera deeply immersed herself in her character by studying the history of rickshaws and Bangladeshi folk art. She explored the ties between folk art, cinema posters, and rickshaws, uncovering how rickshaws once served as mobile billboards for film advertisements. For \"Rickshaw Girl\", she worked with Solaiman Hossain, one of the most well-known rickshaw artists in Bangladesh.\nWhen you put so much effort and time into a project, it's only natural to feel disheartened when your work gets replicated for a television drama. Novera faced the same sentiment when a project, also titled \"Rickshaw Girl\", was featured on television, starring Tanjin Tisha.\n\"A few years ago, I woke up to a message from someone who sent me a newspaper interview. It featured Tanjin Tisha as the 'Rickshaw Girl'. At first, I thought it was a mistake—maybe they had printed an irrecognisable photo of me. However, it turned out to be Tanjin Tisha in 'brownface', intentionally exhibiting a 'darker' complexion through makeup, portraying a character in what turned out to be a TV ripoff of my film. They even copied the exact colour and style of my costume for it!\" exclaimed Novera.\n\"It felt like someone had not only done 'brownface' to represent me but also stolen my artwork before it could reach its audience. It broke my heart. Unfortunately, I don't think Bangladesh has strong copyright laws to protect artistes and creators. It seems anyone can take someone's idea, replicate it, and move forward without facing any consequences,\" added the artiste.\nMany female-oriented films have been produced in recent times, but while they receive critical acclaim, they often lack commercial success.\n\"I think this happens because the characters aren't complex enough—audiences enjoy watching layered, multidimensional characters, regardless of gender. These films often focus heavily on struggles but fail to include enough entertainment value to draw in viewers. I believe this will improve as more female screenwriters and directors emerge to share stories from our own perspectives,\" she asserted.\nThe release of \"Rickshaw Girl\" in Bangladesh marks the end of an era for young Novera Rahman after being called that for the better part of a decade. \"It's a relief, a huge one, for me.

I'll even portray a sweeper if the role demands it. I'm willing to take on any challenge, depending on the director's vision,\" stated the emerging talent Rizvi Rizu. The young actor has been winning over audiences with his diverse range of characters—from playing the lovable Parkes in \"Hawa\" to a devoted husband in \"Priyo Maloti\", the fierce Kaiser in the \"Waqt\" episode of \"Dui Shaw\", and a courageous, down-to-earth refugee in \"Feu\". With each new role, he continues to push his limits, showing no signs of slowing down.\nIn an interview with The Daily Star, the actor opened up about his love for acting, the challenges he has faced, and much more.\nWhile working as an assistant director, Rizvi Rizu caught the attention of Mejbaur Rahman Sumon, who cast him as the lively Parkes. The character instantly resonated with audiences, marking a turning point in Rizvi's career as he discovered his passion for acting.\nHe fully immerses himself in his roles, despite not having a theatre background. \"Letting go of Parkes was one of the hardest things I've ever done,\" he admitted. \"I transformed everything—my appearance, body language, even my hair—to become him. My friends were scared of the person I had become, but the love I received for that character made it all worthwhile.\"\nHowever, the showbiz industry is notorious for typecasting, when asked if he fears being offered supporting roles, the actor replied \"I never felt like I was playing a supporting role—every character I've portrayed has felt like a main one,\" he said. \"I have no problem playing a lead or a supporting role that adds depth to the story. As long as the character is versatile, I'm happy. Being born and raised in a village doesn't limit me to playing a village boy—I can just as easily be a tea stall owner, a chairman, or even an MP, as long as the role challenges me as an artiste.\"\nThe name Polash seems to have an uncanny connection with Rizvi Rizu, as he has portrayed characters with this name in both \"Priyo Maloti\" and \"Feu\". Interestingly, both versions of Polash share a similarity—they are grounded, kind-hearted, and devoted husbands. In \"Priyo Maloti\" he was allowed to showcase a softer, more nurturing character. \"Polash's death scene in 'Priyo Maloti' was particularly challenging for me, because of the emotional depth and the mental strain I had to face while wearing prosthetic makeup,\" he reflected.\nDuring the death scene, Rizvi had to wear the prosthetic makeup for 22-23 hours which was an insane amount of time. \"All credit goes to my prosthetic artiste, Sworna Bhoumick,\" he shared. The makeup process began at 3am and wasn't completed until 8am. After filming, it was finally removed at around 1:30am.\nThe biggest challenge was eating—he could only consume liquids through a small hole in the prosthetic. To eat some solid food, the team had to trim the upper part slightly. \"The extreme heat and humidity caused sweating and itching, but I didn't want to remove the prosthetic makeup, as it would have taken hours to redo and delayed the production,\" he explained.\nIn becoming one with his character, Rizvi Rizu often pushes himself to the point of injury. \"In 'Feu', I had a fight scene where I had to run at full speed through a forest, and the sharp leaves pierced my feet. In 'Waqt', I severely injured my thumb while holding a saw incorrectly. My thumb was on the body of the saw, and when I turned it on, it started moving and tore my skin. I suffered for 15-20 days, and everyone was terrified,\" he recalled.\nWhen asked if screen space matters, Rizvi Rizu replied, \"I don't worry about it—if I'm on screen for one minute, that minute should leave a lasting impression. If people make a meme of my dialogue, I'd welcome it as a reflection of my acting skills.\"\n\n\"If you ask me to perform an action scene, I'll do it; if you want romance, I'll do it.

I'm confident the audience will find it deeply engaging.\"\nThis is Nisho's second film, following his debut in \"Surongo\", directed by Raihan Rafi, where he shared the screen with Tama Mirza. \"Dagi\" marks their second on-screen collaboration after \"Surongo\".\nIn addition to Nisho and Tama, the film stars Sunerah Binte Kamal and Rashed Mamun Apu in key roles.\nProduced jointly by SVF, Alpha i Entertainment, and Chorki, \"Daagi\" is poised to be one of the most anticipated releases this Eid-ul-Fitr.\nকাল আনুষ্ঠানিকভাবে দলটির শীর্ষ নেতৃত্বের নাম ঘোষণা করা হবে।",

The couple was found dead yesterday afternoon at their Santa Fe, New Mexico, home, the Santa Fe County Sheriff's office confirmed. While the cause of death is still under investigation, there are no immediate signs of foul play, authorities reported.\nSheriff's deputies responded to a call at the couple's residence, where they discovered Hackman, Arakawa, and their dog. In a statement, Sheriff Adan Mendoza emphasised that there was no threat to the public. \"We're in the middle of a preliminary death investigation, waiting on approval of a search warrant,\" he said before the identities were officially confirmed.\nHackman, a towering figure in American cinema, was one of the most revered actors of his generation. His range, charisma, and grace on screen made him a household name. From his first major role as Clyde Barrow's older brother in \"Bonnie and Clyde\" (1967) to his defining portrayal of the rogue cop Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle in \"The French Connection\" (1971), Hackman solidified his place among Hollywood's elite.\nHis performance in \"The French Connection\" earned him an Academy Award for Best Actor, a recognition that came after years of steady work in television and theatre. He was soon regarded as one of the industry's finest, known for his ability to embody roles ranging from lower-class characters to high-powered executives seamlessly. His versatility, akin to legends like James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart, allowed him to transcend typecasting.\nThroughout his illustrious career, Hackman delivered memorable performances in numerous films, including his iconic turn as Lex Luthor in the \"Superman\" films, his role as a basketball coach in \"Hoosiers\", and as an FBI agent in \"Mississippi Burning\", which garnered him a fourth Oscar nomination.\nEven as Hackman approached his later years, he delivered powerful performances. His portrayal of a journalist embroiled in a Central American revolution in \"Under Fire\" (1983) and his gripping role in \"Crimson Tide\" (1995) are just a few examples of his enduring talent. His final film appearance came in 2004's \"Welcome to Mooseport\", after which he retired from acting.\nHackman's legacy extends beyond the screen. A passionate writer, he co-authored several novels with underwater archaeologist Daniel Lenihan, including \"Wake of the Perdido Star\" (1999) and \"Escape From Andersonville\" (2008). Hackman also wrote solo works, including \"Payback at Morning Peak\" (2011).\nBorn in San Bernardino, California, Hackman's early life was far from the glamour of Hollywood. At 16, he enlisted in the Marine Corps, serving in Shanghai, Hawaii, and Japan. After his military service, Hackman briefly studied journalism at the University of Illinois before pursuing acting at the Pasadena Playhouse. His early years in New York saw him struggle to find steady work, but his perseverance eventually paid off, leading to a distinguished career.\nHackman was married twice, first to Faye Maltese, with whom he had three children before their divorce in 1986. In 1991, he married Betsy Arakawa, a classical pianist, with whom he spent the final years of his life in Santa Fe.\nHis death marks the end of an era for Hollywood, as Hackman was not only an exceptional actor but also a symbol of an era of cinema that prized character-driven performances over spectacle. Hackman leaves behind a body of work that will continue to resonate with audiences and remain a cornerstone of American film history.\nHe is survived by his children, Christopher, Elizabeth, and Leslie.\nGene Hackman, the acclaimed actor known for his Oscar-winning roles in \"The French Connection\" and \"Unforgiven\", has passed away at 95, along with his wife, classical pianist Betsy Arakawa, aged 63.

Global K-pop idol Jisoo, a member of the internationally acclaimed group Blackpink, is set to take on the lead role in \"Boyfriend on Demand\", a romantic drama series centred on a young, overworked Korean woman who turns to a virtual reality dating programme as an escape—where she encounters the ideal boyfriends she has always dreamed of.\nJisoo will portray Mi-rae, a webtoon producer whose relentless work schedule has left her with no time for romance. Though she longs for a fresh start in love, her busy lifestyle has led her to accept her non-existent dating life. However, when she unexpectedly comes into possession of a mysterious device called the \"Monthly Boyfriend,\" she decides to give it a try. This device transports her into a virtual world where she meets impossibly perfect partners, rekindling her long-suppressed desire for romance.\nStarring opposite Jisoo is singer-turned-actor Seo In-guk, known for his roles in \"Doom at Your Service\" and \"Café Minamdang\". He plays Park Kyeong-nam, a fellow webtoon producer and Mi-rae's professional rival. According to Netflix's synopsis, Kyeong-nam is \"capable and competent at work, but Mi-rae feels uneasy around him. Despite his indifferent and cold demeanour, he's a character with surprising secrets, sure to stir emotions in Mi-rae.\"\nThe series is being directed by Kim Jung-sik, who previously helmed the hit web dramas \"Work Later, Drink Now\" and \"No Gain No Love\". Moreover, Netflix describes \"Boyfriend on Demand\" as a carefully crafted blend of romance and comedy, promising both heartwarming moments and lighthearted humour.\nJisoo, a dominant force in the K-pop industry since Blackpink's debut in 2016, made history with her first solo release, \"Me\", which became the first single album by a female Korean artiste to surpass one million sales within just two days of its launch in 2023.\nRecently, she has been making strides in acting. She made her debut as a lead actress in the historical romance drama \"Snowdrop\" (2021), produced by JCTB, which became Disney+'s first major Korean drama hit. More recently, she has been seen in Coupang Play's fantasy-horror romance \"Newtopia\", which follows a couple attempting to reunite as South Korea is overrun by a zombie outbreak. The series is available to stream on Amazon Prime Video in the US.\nWith \"Boyfriend on Demand\", Netflix continues to expand its already extensive lineup of Korean content for 2025. The platform has announced an ambitious slate that includes 22 scripted dramas, eight reality series, and eight original films. Among the most anticipated releases are the third and final season of \"Squid Game\", set to premiere on June 27, and a new season of the dating show \"Single's Inferno\".\nNetflix is gearing up for its next highly anticipated and conceptually intriguing Korean drama.

Over the years, he has participated in numerous national age-group, youth, and senior-level gymnastics championships, earning nearly 50 medals, including gold medals in the pommel horse and all-around events at the 2019 Singapore Open. After clinching three golds and one silver at the 37th National Gymnastics Championships, which concluded on Tuesday at the NSC Gymnasium, he spoke toThe Daily Star's Anisur Rahmanabout his journey, as well as his personal and collective aspirations for Bangladesh gymnastics. The excerpts of the interview are as follows:\nThe Daily Star (DS):You returned home empty-handed in your debut appearance in the 2021 Bangladesh Games, but you stunned all by winning two golds and one silver in your second appearance at the senior level. How did you transform yourself?\nMenton Tony Mro (MTM):During the Covid outbreak, we received uninterrupted training at the Quantum Cosmo School before joining the national training camp in 2022 under Korean coach Cho Sung Dong until June 2024. I never gave up because I dream of becoming a world-class gymnast in the pommel horse event… To be honest, I got more than I expected from the championships.\nDS:How much are gymnasts benefiting from the National Gymnastics Championships, held after a four-year gap?\nMTM:If the national championships are held every year, the number of gymnasts and teams will increase, and the gymnasts will also be able to evaluate themselves in competitions.\nDS:Quantum Cosmo School dominates all gymnastic competitions. What is the secret behind its success?\nMTM:The gymnasts of Quantum School rise early every morning to meditate before starting a 4-kilometre run. Then, they do two hours of training before going to school to study. In the afternoon, there is another three-and-a-half-hour training session before doing homework for school at night.\nDS:What facilities does the school provide for the gymnasts?\nMTM:Initially, there were almost no facilities in 2013 because every apparatus was either broken or old. There was not even a proper floor facility, but compared to 2013, the facilities at Quantum School are now more or less good.\nDS:Korean coach Cho Sung Dong left the country in June last year. Do you feel his absence in the national training camp?\nMTM:Under his guidance, we trained for eight hours a day -- two sessions per day -- with proper food provided by the federation. But now, the federation can't provide proper food, so the training hours have been reduced to five. We are trying to improve ourselves, but we can't reach the same level as we did under the Korean coach.\nDS:How do you see the Bangladesh Gymnastics Federation's target to qualify directly for the 2028 Olympic Games, especially without a foreign coach?\nMTM:We still believe in qualifying directly for the 2028 Olympic Games. We are not giving up our hopes despite the departure of the Korean coach. We don't want to dwell on what we have lost; rather, we want to progress with whatever we have in our hands.\nDS:The 2028 Olympics are still far away. Do you think the appointment of a foreign coach and proper facilities can help Bangladeshi gymnasts qualify?\nMTM:Firstly, an athlete needs mental and physical stability, and secondly, motivation. Without proper facilities and a good coach, you can't achieve the target. Nevertheless, the appointment of a foreign coach and improved facilities will help gymnasts realise their dream.\nDS:What is your personal target?\nMTM:As a Quantum gymnast, I am still motivated by the dream of winning an Olympic gold medal. We are improving ourselves gradually. However, I want to be the first Bangladeshi gymnast to qualify directly for the Olympic Games on merit. I am confident that one day, I will enter the Olympics by proving my performance.\nMenton Tony Mrobegan his gymnastics journey in 2013 as a Grade-1 student at Bandarban's Quantum Cosmo School. Over the years, he has participated in numerous national age-group, youth, and senior-level gymnastics championships, earning nearly 50 medals, including gold medals in the pommel horse and all-around events at the 2019 Singapore Open. After clinching three golds and one silver at the 37th National Gymnastics Championships, which concluded on Tuesday at the NSC Gymnasium, he spoke toThe Daily Star's Anisur Rahmanabout his journey, as well as his personal and collective aspirations for Bangladesh gymnastics. The excerpts of the interview are as follows:\nThe Daily Star (DS):You returned home empty-handed in your debut appearance in the 2021 Bangladesh Games, but you stunned all by winning two golds and one silver in your second appearance at the senior level. How did you transform yourself?\nMenton Tony Mro (MTM):During the Covid outbreak, we received uninterrupted training at the Quantum Cosmo School before joining the national training camp in 2022 under Korean coach Cho Sung Dong until June 2024. I never gave up because I dream of becoming a world-class gymnast in the pommel horse event… To be honest, I got more than I expected from the championships.\nDS:How much are gymnasts benefiting from the National Gymnastics Championships, held after a four-year gap?\nMTM:If the national championships are held every year, the number of gymnasts and teams will increase, and the gymnasts will also be able to evaluate themselves in competitions.\nDS:Quantum Cosmo School dominates all gymnastic competitions. What is the secret behind its success?\nMTM:The gymnasts of Quantum School rise early every morning to meditate before starting a 4-kilometre run. Then, they do two hours of training before going to school to study. In the afternoon, there is another three-and-a-half-hour training session before doing homework for school at night.\nDS:What facilities does the school provide for the gymnasts?\nMTM:Initially, there were almost no facilities in 2013 because every apparatus was either broken or old. There was not even a proper floor facility, but compared to 2013, the facilities at Quantum School are now more or less good.\nDS:Korean coach Cho Sung Dong left the country in June last year. Do you feel his absence in the national training camp?\nMTM:Under his guidance, we trained for eight hours a day -- two sessions per day -- with proper food provided by the federation. But now, the federation can't provide proper food, so the training hours have been reduced to five.

The show, hosted by lyricist Kabir Bakul, featured Nafis Kamal recounting the story behind the song.\nAccording to Nafis Kamal, \"Shorone Ritwik\" was written with profound emotions, capturing the intense bond, sentiments, and sense of loss between Ritwik Ghatak and Kausar Ahmed Chaudhury.\nThe long-unreleased song has been reimagined with Syed Kallol's composition and Tushar Rahman's musical arrangement. Ershadul Haque, the CEO of the production company Cool Exposure, stated that Kausar Ahmed Chaudhury himself had entrusted Nafis Kamal with this song for musical arrangement, although he did not live to hear the final composition.\nThe Studio Abol Tabol team has created an animated visual representation of the song. Commenting on this new release, composer Syed Kallol mentioned that the song reflects the struggles, hardships, and search for the identity of the Bengali people through its portrayal of art, literature, music, and cinema.\nFrom Australia, Kawsar Ahmed Chowdhury's only son, Prateek, expressed his gratitude to Prothom Alo, Cool Exposure, Abol Tabol, Universal Medical, and his childhood friend Nafis Kamal for bringing this unreleased song to the public. He also contributed to the project by providing the original script, photographs, and other relevant materials from that time.\nKausar Ahmed Chaudhury passed away on February 22, 2022.\n\nকাল আনুষ্ঠানিকভাবে দলটির শীর্ষ নেতৃত্বের নাম ঘোষণা করা হবে।",

        "headline": "The VAR Review: Salah's penalty claim for Liverpool; Dorgu red card",
        "body": "Video Assistant Referee causes controversy every week in thePremier League, but how are decisions made, and are they correct?\nAfter each round of matches we take a look at the major incidents, to examine and explain the process both in terms of VAR protocol and the Laws of the Game.\nIn the midweek VAR Review:ShouldMohamed Salahhave been given a penalty vs. Newcastle? How doesPatrick Dorgu's red card forManchester Uniteddiffer from other VAR decisions? And howAston Villafound out that offside continues to be inconsistent.\nWhat happened:The game was only three minutes old whenMohamed Salahlooked to burst pastLewis Halldown the right wing. TheNewcastle Uniteddefender tumbled to the ground and, in the process, as Salah entered the area he was brought down. Referee Stuart Attwell gave a free kick to Newcastle, and the move was checked by the VAR, Matt Donohue.\nVAR decision:No penalty.\nVAR review:The referee gave a defensive free kick before the possible penalty, so was this reviewable by the VAR? Or did play stop at the point Salah was ruled to have fouled Hall?\n\nThe VAR is effectively in play until the referee blows the whistle to stop play. So if it was blown before the potential penalty, the VAR has no role as play was already dead. But the whistle didn't go until Salah went to ground, the VAR can assess the passage of play as a whole.\nThe weight of the original decision to give a foul against Salah was the determining factor. As Attwell had given a free kick, deeming that Salah pushed Hall, that has to be clearly and obviously wrong itself before any assessment for a spot kick.\nVerdict:It was a soft decision to penalise theEgyptinternational, and probably not a foul, but it wasn't not close to the threshold which would have seen the VAR fully consider a penalty.\nThere would have been a strong case for a spot kick, too, as Hall appeared to place his right arm across Salah, causing him to go down.\nWhat happened:The game was in the 40th minute whenPatrick DorguchallengedOmari Hutchinsonby the touchline, getting contact on the ball and putting it out of play. Referee Darren England gave a throw-in, but theIpswich Townplayer was down holding his shin. The tackle was checked by the VAR, Craig Pawson, for serious foul play. (watch here)\nVAR decision:Red card.\nVAR review:It's a textbook example of when point of contact and level of force come together for a serious foul play red card.\nThere are lots of incidents where an opponent is caught above the ankle, even on the shin, but if the player is stepping into the challenge, and makes limited or glancing contact, it will be seen as reckless rather than dangerous.\nOne such example was Moises Caicedo's challenge on Pape Matar Sarr in December: high contact but little to no force applied.\nDorgu's only intention was to play the ball and not the man, but Hutchinson's leg almost shuddered with the challenge -- an unmistakable indicator of excessive force that could endanger the safety of an opponent. The Ipswich Town player was lucky not to sustain an injury and to be able to continue after treatment.\nVerdict:Perhaps we can cut England a little bit of slack for this incident, as he wasn't close to it and hadAlejandro Garnachoin his line of vision. He saw that Dorgu got his foot to the ball, but not the nature of the challenge. Maybe he could have used some help from the fourth official, Sam Barrott, who was much closer.\nThe real surprise is how long it took -- three minutes and 15 seconds from the foul to the referee showing the red card for what was undoubtedly a correct intervention.\nEngland also needed over a minute at the monitor before accepting the upgrade. He wasn't helped by the VAR's first replay, shown at full speed as it should be, being from an unclear angle.\nWhat happened:Crystal Palacetook the lead in the 29th minute whenIsmaïla Sarrscored from close range after the ball had been headed across goal byChris Richards. The goal was cleared by the VAR, Jarred Gillett, but was there a case for offside?\nVAR decision:Goal stands.\nVAR review:Perception is so important when it comes to VAR. Earlier this month, the VAR took over four minutes to try to calculate an offside decision in a game at Crystal Palace, though admittedly that was more challenging to identify the positions of the relevant players.\nThis offside check still took one minute and 41 seconds from the goal being scored to being cleared, but because the lines were not displayed the impression was that the VAR only gave it a cursory glance.\nThe process of the VAR placing the offside lines is done in the background before the final image is sent to the broadcaster. In this case that last stage didn't happen, even though it would have showedLucas Dignein the left-back area was playing Richards onside.\nWhile that might be clear to the VAR with his technology, it looked very close when only a \"naked eye\" picture was used to illustrate it. Being a little bit quicker isn't always satisfactory to the aggrieved.\nIt wasn't helped when little more than 10 minutes later,Morgan Rogershad a goal disallowed (watch here) for a marginal offside againstOllie Watkinsin the build up. There was a small gap between the lines to attacker and defender, meaning Watkins' knee was just in an offside position and beyond the tolerance level within the technology.\nBut if Aston Villa have a goal ruled out by a small margin, then they should expect to see the evidence of a goal they have conceded to a small margin.\nThe VAR will argue that he was supporting the on-field decision for Richards, so the proof wasn't mandatory. With the Watkins goal, he was changing the on-field decision so had to produce the evidence.\nWe saw it withFulham's opening goal againstWolverhampton Wandererson Tuesday too, whenRyan Sessegnonscored (watch here) in the first minute but there was a tight offside. The VAR, Paul Tierney, found it wasn't a close decision when placing the lines so didn't send the image to broadcast, yet it looked very close.\nVerdict:Fans always ask for consistency, and that should include how such tight offside checks are carried out.\nSemi-automated offside debuts in the FA Cup this weekend, and that removes \"line drawing\" from the role of the VAR. The technology will produce a visualisation of all offside decisions, so there should be no reason for these unclear images when the graphic hasn't been pushed through to the broadcaster.\nWhat happened:Jacob Ramseymoved into the area in the 64th minute and as he was about to shoot went tumbling to the ground from a challenge byDaniel Muñoz, who put the ball behind for a corner. Ramsey looked around at referee Sam Barrott hoping for a penalty, but he said no and it was looked at by the VAR.\nVAR decision:No penalty.\nVAR review:When is a player moving behind an attacker a foul challenge? To many, the penalty given toLiverpoolatAFC BournemouthwhenLewis CookclippedCody Gakpowas no different -- though it was given as a penalty on the field. All decisions have their own merits, and the argument in the case of Cook would be that he was running across the back of the opponent and caused the trip.\nWe have seen similar situations to Ramsey across the season, however.\nIn October,Evertonwanted a penalty against Newcastle whenDominic Calvert-Lewinwent down after clipping the leg ofDan Burnas he has pulled his foot back to shoot. Howard Webb, the Premier League's chief refereeing officer,supported no VAR interventionand said he would have expected a spot kick to be cancelled if given on the field.\nTwo weeks later that happened, coincidentally in another Everton game, whenIpswich Townhad a penalty reversed. The VAR, Graham Scott, told referee Michael Oliver that the penalty should be cancelled as Ipswich'sJack Clarkehad caughtDwight McNeilwith his back lift, and that caused him to go down.\nVerdict:The Gakpo penalty will understandably raise questions of consistency in general, but VAR penalties have not been awarded for this kind of contact.\nWhat happened:Erling Haalandthought he had doubled Man City's lead atTottenham Hotspurwith a second goal in the fourth minute of added time, but it was ruled out on the field by referee Jarred Gillett for handball. The VAR, Graham Scott, looked for proof that the decision was wrong.\nVAR decision:No goal.\nVAR review:This is the two-tier handball law in full effect.\nIf the ball touches an attacker's arm, even accidentally, then he cannot immediately score a goal.\nYet if the ball accidently comes off a defender's arm in the same passage of play -- it may have done so forArchie Gray, and it definitely did forKevin Danso-- that isn't punishable by a penalty.\nVerdict:Haaland is extremely unfortunate, because if the goal had been awarded by Gillett it wouldn't have been ruled out. There just wasn't the definitive evidence to determine if the ball came off his bicep on one of two possible occasions, or it it was his chest and/or that of Gray.\nWhat happened:Arsenalwon a corner in 79th minute which was swung to the back post, withMikel Merinoattempting to get a header on goal which deflected wide offChris Wood. Arsenal players appealed for handball, but referee Andy Madley gave a corner. It was checked by the VAR, Michael Salisbury.\nVAR decision:No penalty.\nVAR review:While the ball did hit Wood's arm after it was headed toward goal by Merino, theNottingham Forestplayer didn't have his arm extended away from his body, and it was in an expected position for his movement.\nVerdict:There have only been five penalties awarded for handball through VAR in the Premier League this season, and all have involved the arm being fully out or above shoulder level.\nThe Premier League has worked hard with clubs to make sure the handball law is less intrusive than in other leagues, and you couldn't rule out this being given as a spot kick in one of Europe's other top competitions.\nSome factual parts of this article include information provided by the Premier League and PGMOL.",

        "headline": "Liverpool stroll, Arsenal stutter in season-defining Wednesday",
        "body": "It was a thrilling Wednesday evening ofPremier Leagueaction, as we saw multiple heavyweights face each other in matches that could go some way to ironing out the title race, the top four and everything beyond that.\nLiverpoolextended their lead top of the Premier League with a win against theirCarabao Cupfinal opponentsNewcastle United,Manchester Unitedwere made to sweat it out to defeatIpswich Town,Arsenalfailed to score against a vibrantNottingham Forest, andManchester Citygot it done with a close win overTottenham Hotspur.\nAs the dust settles on a wild night of Premier League action, our ESPN FC reporters take a look at the biggest talking points.\nLIVERPOOL, England--As news of Arsenal's goalless draw with Nottingham Forest filtered through to Anfield, the Kop launched into a rousing rendition of \"We're Gonna Win The League.\"\nWith Liverpool's 2-0 victory over Newcastle United moving the Reds 13 points clear at the top of the Premier League table on Wednesday night, it now seems as if it's a matter of when, rather than if, that prophecy is fulfilled.\nThere may still be more than a quarter of the season left to play, but there was already a celebratory atmosphere on Merseyside as goals fromDominik SzoboszlaiandAlexis Mac Allisterhelped Arne Slot's side brush aside Eddie Howe's men with all the style and swagger of champions-elect.\nSlot watched the contest from the director's box, having been served witha two-match touchline ban by the Football Association after his red card in the Merseyside derby on Feb. 12. But while there was a change of personnel in the dugout -- assistant coach and formerEvertondefender John Heitinga deputised in Slot's absence -- there was no drop-off in performance on the pitch.\nFrom the first whistle, Liverpool looked in control, with their opponent blunted by the absence of in-form strikerAlexander Isak. The hosts took the lead inside 11 minutes when Szoboszlai's tame finish wriggled underNick Popeafter a fine run down the left from the livelyLuis Díaz.\nCallum Wilson, making his first Premier League start of the season for Newcastle, spurned a glorious chance to restore parity after being played through on goal later in the first half, but his effort curled agonisingly wide of the post.\nIt only helped to reinforce the notion that this was Liverpool's night, and so it proved when Mac Allister made sure of the victory after the break. TheArgentinainternational curled brilliantly past Pope after some nifty footwork fromMohamed Salahwho, even without scoring, caused plenty of problems for the Newcastle defence.\nAhead of the match, Slot had urged supporters to keep their expectations high.\n\"We do not just want you to dream, we need you to dream,\" the Dutchman wrote in his programme notes.\n\"This is a big part of what makes this club so special because it challenges the players and the staff to do everything that we possibly can to be the best that we can be.\"\nCertainly, there could be no denying supporters were in dreamland on Wednesday night as they rattled through the Liverpool songbook, delivering lung-busting choruses of \"And Now You're Gonna Believe Us\" and \"Hand It Over, Manchester.\"\nNewcastle's visit to Anfield marked the end of a gruelling run of five games in 15 days for Liverpool. For weeks, this spell has been billed as the stretch in which the title would be won or lost, and, having picked up 11 points from a possible 15, the prospect of Slot's side delivering a record-equaling 20th league title this term now seems likelier than ever.\nAnd now you're gonna believe us? Surely now, there can be no doubting that this is Liverpool's year. --Beth Lindop\nNOTTINGHAM, England -- Arsenal have turned into one of those Christmas toys when the batteries start to run out. They go round and round in circles, doing the same thing over again until they hit the wall and fizzle out completely.\nThat's where Mikel Arteta's Gunners are in this season's Premier League title race.Saturday's 1-0 home defeatagainstWest Ham Unitedwas a huge blow to their hopes of catching leaders Liverpool, but after failing to score again in a 0-0 draw against third-place Nottingham Forest at the City Ground, Arsenal can forget about the title for another year -- just as they have had to do every year for the past two decades.\nNobody can deny that injuries have bitten hard into Arteta's squad and left them with almost nothing in the attacking department.Gabriel JesusandKai Havertzare both out until next season with long-term injuries andBukayo Sakais unlikely to return from his three-month layoff until after the March international break.\nBut after enjoying 65% possession against Forest, Arsenal managed only one effort on target and it was painful to watch Arteta's side perform like a blunt object as they attempted to keep their faint title hopes alive by winning the game.\nIn the absence of Havertz, Jesus and Saka, Arteta is deploying midfielderMikel Merinoas a false nine, but theSpaininternational spent enough of the game far enough forward to be classed as a centre-forward.\nBut Arsenal's tactics remained the same: pass, pass, pass, usually sideways, and then hope for a corner from which to exploit their apparent expertise in the set-piece department. Merino's aerial ability is no secret, but Arsenal continued to play the ball on the ground and refused to go direct to find the breakthrough.\nTheir passing wasn't working and Forest comfortably dealt with every one of Arsenal's 11 corners, so where was the variety?\nArteta has done an incredible job reviving Arsenal during his five years in charge -- the Gunners were drifting into obscurity when he arrived -- but they seem to have hit an impasse. The Spaniard needs to find a way to make things happen as the top coaches do. He needs to be more pragmatic and more willing to abandon his principles when the circumstances dictate.\nBut there is no sign of that happening and Arsenal are drifting out of the title race and could even be in danger of being dragged into a fight for aUEFA Champions Leaguespot if they are unable to escape their malaise.\nWith the fifth position likely to be enough for a Champions League spot in the Premier League to secure a UCL berth, Arsenal's 10-point cushion should be enough to keep sixth-place Newcastle at bay.\nBut it's the 13-point gap between themselves and leaders Liverpool that should concern them most as Arsenal should never have been so far behind the pacesetters this season.-- Mark Ogden\nLONDON -- Where there's Haaland, there's hope. It tookErling Haalandjust 12 minutes to score on his return to the starting lineup as Manchester City edged past Spurs 1-0 at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium to move back into the top four.\nTheNorwayinternational's 28th goal of the season in all competitions was a typically clinical finish, dispatchingJérémy Doku's cross insideGuglielmo Vicario's near post.\nIt was, in truth, the only sign of clinical finishing on show all evening as City spurned a raft of chances to put this game to bed before half-time withSavinhothe biggest culprit -- and Haaland himself could not beat Vicario from six yards with the goal at his mercy at the half-hour mark.\nUltimately -- after another nervy second-half showing from City -- it did not matter. Haaland's 20th Premier League goal of the season made him the second player to surpass that figure in his first three seasons. Ruud Van Nistelrooy did so for Manchester United from 2001 to 2004.\nHe also equalledHarry Kane's record of scoring 10 or more goals at home and 10 or more away across three consecutive seasons. Haaland obviously gives City greater potency in their attack but his contribution was still not enough to mask the fragility that has become a feature of their football in recent months.\nSpurs were dreadful in the first half but gradually roused themselves as the second period wore on with Pep Guardiola reduced to crouching on one knee in the technical area in hope rather than expectation that his team would repel the home side.\nThere might come a point when manager Ange Postecoglou -- as much as he would probably not admit it -- will prioritise the Europa League over the Premier League given they are languishing in 13th place -- and perhaps in hindsight, this was it.\nStarting withoutDejan Kulusevski,Son Heung-minandDjed Spence-- their three best players against Ipswich Town last weekend -- was to manage their load for the weeks ahead rather than in a sincere belief the starting lineup he selected was the strongest available.\nThat rotation no doubt contributed to the slow start and, as has often been the case this season, they left it too late to rally. Haaland almost had the final word, scoring in stoppage time with a powerful run and finish only for the officials to rule he had handled in the build-up.\nThere was still time for City to implode. Spurs raced up the field and substitutePape Matar Sarrheaded over from close range with Guardiola almost in disbelief on the sidelines.\nInstead, Haaland was the match-winner and City were able to solidify their position in the Champions League spots ahead of Saturday'sFA Cupfifth-round game againstPlymouth Argyle.-- James Olley\nMANCHESTER, England -- It was a big win for Manchester United against Ipswich Town, particularly after conceding an early goal and playing for more than 45 minutes with 10 men.\nBut if the pressure on Ruben Amorim has eased ever so slightly, it's ramping up onAndré Onana.\nThe goalkeeper played his part inJaden Philogene's opener after only four minutes when his miscommunication withPatrick Dorguled to the simplest of chances. Ipswich's second goal wasn't much better. Philogene whipped in a hopeful cross from the right and Onana was left stationary as it drifted into the far corner without a touch from anyone.\nIt's a familiar story.Abdoulaye Doucouréwas able to score for Everton on Saturday after Onana could only parry a shot into the air. A similar situation led to Everton's penalty -- eventually overturned -- in stoppage time and Tottenham's winner a week earlier.\nWith United holding on against Ipswich, Onana punted a goal kick straight down the middle of the pitch. As it landed at the feet of an Ipswich defender, inviting another attack, both Amorim andBruno Fernandesthrew their hands into the air. It was another poor decision on a night of poor decisions.\nDan Thomas is joined by Craig Burley, Shaka Hislop and others to bring you the latest highlights and debate the biggest storylines.Stream on ESPN+ (U.S. only).\nThere's growing clamour to drop Onana. It will increase further after his performance against Ipswich, but it's unlikely Amorim will act.\nSecond choiceAltay Bayindiris injured and hasn't featured in the matchday squad since a2-0 defeattoCrystal Palaceat the beginning of February. Amorim named two young goalkeepers on the bench against Ipswich --Elyh HarrisonandHubert Graczyk-- but neither of them are ready for first-team football.\nIt's possible Bayindir could be in goal for the FA Cup tie againstFulhamon Saturday after being promised he would play in the cup games at the start of the season by former boss Erik ten Hag, but it will depend on theTurkeyinternational proving his fitness in the next three days.\nThe more likely scenario is that Onana continues, and United fans continue to feel nerves anytime the ball goes near him.\nAt least the mood around the club will brighten after just their second home league win of 2025. Fernandes impressed again in midfield and all three United goals came from his set pieces. Two from corners and one from a free kick.\nUnited's past six goals have all come from Fernandes set pieces. It's a vital tool, especially when they're struggling to create clear-cut chances from open play. It was another frustrating night forRasmus Højlundand Dorgu is facing a suspension following his red card.\nAlong with Onana's form, there are still plenty of problems for Amorim to solve. But he will enjoy his drive in Carrington a little more Thursday morning after watching his team come up with a battling performance in a game they had to win.\nMoving up to 14th in the table isn't much to celebrate, but it's at least a step in the right direction.-- Rob Dawson",

        "headline": "FIH Pro League: Karkera, Mandeep shine for Indian men; women make positive strides with attacking approach",
        "body": "The Bhubaneswar leg of the 2024-25 FIH Pro League finished on Tuesday with both the Indian men's and women's teams impressing in their last games. The men finished with five wins out of eight and are currently sitting third on the table behind England and Belgium but only by a point. The women have two wins out of eight and a shootout victory against the Netherlands which took them to nine points from eight matches and sixth on the table.\nHere are the takeaways from an interesting fortnight for both the Indian teams:\nVictories over England and Germany followed by a very impressive 2-2 draw against the Netherlands were impressive from the Indian women's team. Inconsistency is an issue but Salima Tete and co. have shown improvements on the field and were able to get positive results against quality sides.\nHarendra Singh's style focuses on high work rate and quick transitions, which the team managed to showcase in their matches. Harendra also wanted to improve the finishing aspect which was seen during these games, especially with Deepika, Baljeet Kaur and Rutuja Dadaso Pisal's goals. Apart from the two matches against Spain and Germany, which they lost 0-1 and 0-4, the team played to their strengths. There's no doubt that the scope for improvement is there, mostly with regards to consistency, but it looks like the team is on the right track.\nFive wins out of eight is impressive from the men's team and it included victories over Spain, Germany, England and Ireland. The team defended well, in fact they conceded the least number goals -- 12 - among all the nations in the first half of this Pro League season. But if there's one issue, it is penalty corner conversion.\nIt was only in the fifth match -- against the Irish -- that India converted their first penalty corner in the leg and that too was a variation. In fact, it was only in the final game against England that Harmanpreet Singh scored direct penalty corners.\nJugraj Singh came into the tournament with red hot form thanks to his exploits at the Hockey India League, where he scored 12 goals but he failed to replicate the same for the national team. He played in all eight games, got the chances to score from penalty corners but failed to convert. India scored field goals thanks to Mandeep Singh, Sukhjeet Singh, Abhishek and Gurjant Singh, so the lack of penalty corner goals didn't really impact the team but Jugraj will know that he hasn't delivered when it was needed, even when Harmanpreet missed three games due to an injury.\nThere's Amandeep Lakra waiting on the sidelines who also impressed in the HIL with his dragflicks. Fulton will now have to decide whether he persists with Jugraj, who's no doubt the second best after Harmanpreet when it comes to dragflicks or give a chance to a youngster.\nFor the men, there are usual names like Hardik Singh, Abhishek, and Amit Rohidas who rarely have bad games but the standout ones were Mandeep Singh, Rajinder Singh and goalkeeper Suraj Karkera.\nThere was some sort of pressure on Mandeep as the veteran had not been in great form but the eight games gave him a chance to prove why Fulton should continue to pick him. He scored three goals, which included a range of finishes, from smashing past the Irish goalkeeper to a deft deflection from a penalty corner.\nKrishan Pathak became the India no. 1 after PR Sreejesh's retirement but he now faces competition from Karkera whose composure during the set pieces stood out. He will get more chances to play and will become an India regular in the coming years.\nMeanwhile, Rajinder's stick skills also impressed, especially in the first four matches. Based on this outing, it looks like he will continue to get opportunities in the future.\nIn the women's team, Rutuja had her moments as a forward. Savita Punia was as usual at her best as the goalkeeper. But big credit should go to Deepika who ended up scoring three goals. She made massive improvements to her dragflicking skills as well as with her field goals. The goal she scored in the second match against the Netherlands was one of the best field goals in the tournament. Harendra spoke about maintaining calm in the circle and the goal was the best example of it.\nBoth Indian teams will now play their remaining Pro League matches in the month of June. There are talks ongoing for both teams to play bilateral series before those Pro League games as well.",

        "headline": "All in the family: Yashdeep Siwach inspired by mother Pritam's fighting spirit",
        "body": "A few years back during lockdown, a unique scene played out at the Siwach household. Four members of the family -- mother, father, son and daughter -- went to the nearby small open area and started knocking the ball to each other with their hockey sticks. The mother, Pritam Siwach, is a former India captain. Kuldeep, the father, is also a former player and state-level coach. The son, Yashdeep, is now playing for the senior Indian team. The daughter Kanika has played for the juniors and looks destined to make the national team.\nIt's an out-an-out hockey family. If all four are at home, they watch the matches together. The dinner table conversations are almost always about the sport. When the kids are playing, the parents watch their matches to analyse and later share their notes. Sometimes, there are even not-so-serious fights between them because of hockey.\nSince the parents were associated with the sport for a long time, one may assume that they also pushed their children into taking up the same sport. But Pritam and Kuldeep didn't do that. More than their parents' career, it was hockey itself that attracted the children.\n\"My mother, from the beginning, told me to follow my heart and just enjoy.... whether I wanted to study or play sports. But in the end, hockey is in my blood. I have played various sports but from 2015, I started taking hockey seriously. It became so interesting that I couldn't come out of it,\" Yashdeep, who is 24 now and playing for India in the ongoing FIH Pro League, tells ESPN.\n\nView this post on Instagram\nA post shared by Yashdeep Siwach (@yashdeepsiwach)\nYashdeep remembers the moments that made him fall for the sport. One was a sub-junior national tournament where his father was the coach of the Haryana team. Even though his parents spoke a lot about hockey at home, the moment he saw a live match, he fell in love. Another instance was when the Indian team was practicing at the national stadium in Delhi. He saw the training sessions and was taken over by the 'spirit and hard work' of the players.\nThe love towards the sport has to come naturally. Pritam, who's an Arjuna and a Dronacharya award winner, was clear that her children should discover their own path. More importantly for her, they should enjoy and have fun.\n\"As a parent, I told them to do their own thing. I gave them the freedom to choose, and I never told them not to play hockey. I made them play all sports, from swimming to horse riding. They shouldn't feel that I put pressure on them to play just hockey,\" says Pritam.\nShe added that her children deserve appreciation for creating their own journey despite facing external pressure because of her own legacy. \"Everybody will compare my children with me. They might say, 'he's Pritam's child, so he's here because of recommendation'. They have a lot of pressure, but I told them not to take the pressure, if you're good enough, you'll play. And I appreciate them that they have reached a certain level facing that pressure.\"\nAfter her playing career, which included the Commonwealth Games gold medal in 2002, Pritam, along with Kuldeep, started a very successful academy which nurtured many past and current players. At the recent Hockey India League, there were as many as 12 players who belonged to her academy, including the likes of India internationals Neha Goyal, Sharmila Devi, Jyoti, and Nisha.\nHandling pressure is also one of the most important lessons she teaches her students in the academy. She doesn't want her students to come in with an idea of making hockey as a career option, she wants them to play for the joy they have for the sport.\n\"Don't try to make the sport your career. Keep the sport as your entertainment. If you do that, you'll automatically play well. You see foreign players, they do it for their own entertainment, not thinking about careers. I believe and I tell the same thing to my academy students that it's important to study and play sports for entertainment. If you take pressure, you won't become a good player,\" she says.\nThe pressure part doesn't affect Yashdeep, but he does often think about his mother's achievements. It's something that he's taking as an inspiration as well as a benchmark. \"My mother has achieved so much, why can't we do it and make her proud? I keep saying the same thing to my sister as well. She did so much, the least we can do is to give our 100 percent.\"\nThe fighting spirit of his parents is what Yashdeep considers as his biggest inheritance. When his mother decided to become a hockey player, she faced a lot of resistance, even from her own family. When his parents wanted to start their academy in Sonepat, they didn't have a lot of help. They faced financial, administrative and equipment issues, but they never gave up. \"They don't worry about results, they put in everything. They all go in. That's my biggest learning from my parents and coaches.\"\nThere's one area though where Yashdeep is vastly different from his mother, and more like his father. It's on the field. As a player, he's a defender while Pritam was an aggressive and skilful striker who loved scoring the goals.\nWhen he took up the sport, Yashdeep never wanted to become a goal-scorer, he was always interested in feeding the ball to his fellow teammates. Just like his father who played as a midfielder and liked to control the proceedings and make assists. \"Even when I watch football matches, I like players who are defenders and those who make the assists. From the beginning, I was interested only in defence,\" says Yashdeep.\nHis mother sees more of her game in her daughter who's also a forward. \"Meh aage fighter thi, mujhe goal chahiye tha chahe kuch bhi hojaye(I was a fighter up front, I needed to score goals at all costs.) Maybe I see that in my daughter, to play forward and to score goals.\"\n\nView this post on Instagram\nA post shared by Kans (@_kanikasiwach)\nNow that they are making their mark in the national teams, both parents want Yashdeep and Kanika to focus on experiencing the highs and the lows that comes with representing India. Their ultimate goal is to win Olympic medals, but the focus is always on the present, like their parents told them to. \"They us to experience the sport completely. They did it and now they want us to do it -- all the different feelings when your team does well and when it doesn't,\" says Yashdeep.",

Join us for the latest transfer news, rumours and gossip from around the globe.\nTransfers homepage|Done deals|Men's January grades|Women's January grades\n-Man United's Amorim to talk with Garnacho after tunnel exit-Beard sacked as Liverpool women's manager-The Football Reporters:Should Son and Tottenham part ways?\n- Manchester United are desperate to solve their goal-scoring problems ahead of next season, andCalciomercatoreports that the Red Devils are ready to offloadRasmus Højlundas part of the rebuild. Højlund has scored only twoPremier Leaguegoals in 21 appearances in this campaign, with the initial €64m paid toAtalantain the summer of 2023 now looking expensive. The report says that United will offer Højlund the chance to return toSerie Awith Napoli as part of a proposal to signVictor Osimhen. The Nigeria international is on loan at Galatasaray for the rest of the season, and in the summer he will move into the final year of his Napoli contract. United hope common ground can be found which will see Osminhen head to Old Trafford for a fee of €40m plus Højlund.\n-Liverpoolhave a \"growing interest\" inNewcastle UnitedforwardAlexander Isak,The Timesreports. WhileArsenalhave long been regarded as the 25-year-old's biggest suitors, a summer exit for Reds strikerDarwin Núñezcould change that. Isak is under contract at St. James' Park until June 2028 and likely would command a transfer fee of more than £100m. Should Liverpool recoup much of the £85m they spent to sign Núñez, amid strong interest from theSaudi Pro League, then a deal for Isak could well become a reality. Newcastle, meanwhile, will soon commence talks with the Sweden international over a new contract.\n- Palmeiras are closing in on a deal to signBarcelonaforwardVitor Roque,Fabrizio Romanoreports. An agreement between the two clubs was struck last week over a package worth more than €25m, which also includes a future transfer clause.Real Betis, where Roque has been on loan this season, are set to be presented with their compensation options. The 19-year-old has been a regular for Betis in LaLiga this season, contributing four goals in 22 matches.\n-Manchester Citycould face competition from Barcelona this summer if they press ahead with plans to signFC PortogoalkeeperDiogo Costa, according toMundo Deportivo. The 25-year-old is highly regarded at Barca, and is viewed by the club as a possible long-term replacement for current No. 1Marc-André ter Stegen. City, meanwhile, are planning for life afterÉderson, who has been heavily linked with a move to Saudi. Should he make the switch, Costa is expected to be right at the top of Pep Guardiola's summer transfer wishlist.\n-Bayern Munichhave withdrawn their contract offer to full-backJoshua Kimmich, according toBILD. TheGermanyinternational was widely expected to ink a new deal that would keep him at the club for several more years, but talks appear to have hit a stumbling block. Kimmich's contract is set to expire at the end of the season, meaning he'll become a free agent this summer if fresh terms cannot be agreed.\n-FC Dallasare finalizing a $4m deal to sign Gremio midfielderKaick, writesCésar Luis Merlo. The 19-year-old Brazilian is yet to make his senior debut for Gremio, but is regarded as a promising young player at the club. Kaick is expected to sign a four-year contract with theMLSoutfit, which will include a 12-month extension option. According to Merlo, the two clubs involved in the deal are now \"exchanging documents.\"\n- Liverpool are lining up Brighton forwardJoão Pedroas a replacement for Saudi-linkedDarwin Núñez, according toTeamTalk. TheUruguayinternational has struggled for form this season under coach Arne Slot and was heavily linked with a move toAl Nassrin January prior toJhon Durán's move. According to the outlet, offers for Núñez from the Saudi Pro League are expected to arrive this summer, leaving the Reds with a big decision. If the 25-year-old does depart,Brazilinternational Pedro, who has scored seven goals in 21Premier Leagueappearances for the Seagulls this season, is top of Slot's shortlist.\n- TheSaudi Pro Leagueis willing to offer €240m forReal MadridsuperstarVinícius Júniorthis summer, theDaily Telegraphreports. The Brazil international is a concrete target for a number of Saudi clubs, although any transfer will be dependent on his final approval. It isn't yet clear which club will table the bid for Vinícius, althoughAl Hilalhave been mooted as a potential destination. Should the 24-year-old move for a fee above the £240m mark, he will become the most expensive player in history, surpassing fellow BrazilianNeymarafter his move fromBarcelonatoParis Saint-Germain.\n-AC Milanleft-backTheo Hernándezis a possible transfer target for Man City, reportsTeamTalk. The 27-year-old is about to move into the final year of his contract and there's no sign of an extension.Serie ArivalsComoagreed a €50m fee for theFranceinternational in January, but the player rejected the move hoping for a bigger switch at the end of the season.

Arsenal made a move for the 23-year-old last summer but wouldn't meet his €25m release clause. Manchester City, Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain are also tracking him ahead of the summer window.\nESPN's Rob Dawson considers the merits of the Højlund-Osimhen deal.\nMan United are looking for a striker in the summer and Victor Osimhen is a player they've looked at in the past. Sources at Galatasaray have told ESPN that they are almost certain he won't return to the club next season and it's unlikely he will ever play for Napoli again.\nThe Premier League is his most likely destination and while United is one possible option, Chelsea is another.\nOsimhen would fit the bill for United in that he's a proven goal scorer. The club are making a conscious effort to sign younger players, but Osimhen is still only 26 with his peak years ahead of him.\nYou could argue that the Nigeria international is the perfect player to take some of the pressure off younger strikers already at Old Trafford. One of those is Rasmus Højlund, but his future is up in the air. He's struggled this season and looks short of confidence. His stock in Italy remains high after his spell in Serie A with Atalanta, although United would get nothing like the fee they paid if Napoli firmed up their interest.\nThe biggest issue facing United this summer is their limited budget so any deal involving Osimhen and Højlund would have to work financially.\n- Atletico Madrid will demand a fee of more than €50m for midfielderConor Gallagherthis summer amid interest from severalPremier Leagueclubs.

        "body": "The 2024-25 season of the Indian Super League is in full swing, and with games coming thick and fast, this is a convenient place to catch up on every match. We'll have a report after every match, right up to the rest day signalling the end of the matchweek.\nISL Standings|ISL Results and Fixtures|ISL Playoff Scenarios\nHere are the details for matchweek 23 of ISL 2024-25 with the latest match report coming first:\n(Carl McHugh 45')\nFC Goa beat Punjab FC 1-0, solidifying their grip over the second spot, which could guarantee them a straight semi-final berth, while Punjab were mathematically eliminated from the playoffs race.\nFC Goa stepped in with intent, displaying fluidity in their gameplay and produced a well-coordinated corner kick in the eighth minute as Borja Herrera's precise delivery met Odei Onaindia on the far post. Onaindia, however, was positioned laterally, and hence he didn't go for a direct attempt at goal, instead laying up a headed pass for Carl McHugh. Muheet Shabir Khan pre-empted this and stopped it with a timely save in the ninth minute.\nHowever, McHugh was successful in finding the back of the net at the end of the first half. Udanta Singh delivered a long throw-in for the Irish midfielder, who was looking to break into the Punjab FC box with a quick sprint. McHugh met the delivery properly, drilling the ball into the bottom left corner with his left foot to score the only goal of the match.\nPunjab FC kept pressing for the equaliser right until the end, but were not successful.\nWith this win, Goa moved to 45 points in 22 games which puts them ahead of the third and fourth placed Bengaluru FC and Jamshedpur FC respectively by eight points each, though the latter have three games in hand to cut that deficit. Punjab FC are at the 11th place with 24 points from 22 matches.\n(Manoj Mohammed (OG) 86', Raphael Messi Bouli 90+4')\nEast Bengal beat Hyderabad FC 2-0 at the Salt Lake Stadium in Kolkata to make it three wins in a row for the first time in their ISL history. Their two goals came right at the end, with a Manoj Mohammed own goal breaking the deadlock in the 86th minute, before Raphael Messi Bouli's goal in the fourth minute of second half stoppage time.\nEast Bengal are now in eighth spot with 27 points from 22 games.\nManoj's attempted headed clearance off a corner deflected into his own net, before Saul Crespo and Messi Bouli combined for the second goal on a counter-attack, where Crespo was quick to spot the pass through to Messi Bouli in the centre of the Hyderabad box. He slotted into the bottom left corner to double the lead and take three points for Oscar Bruzon's men, who next face Bengaluru FC at home on Sunday.\n(Rahul Bheke 37')\nBengaluru FC are through to the playoffs. Chennaiyin FC won't make it. That, after a sweet Rahul Bheke volley gave Bengaluru a 1-0 win at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium on Tuesday, to make it a league double for Gerard Zaragoza's side against Chennaiyin this season.\nIt was a quick turnaround for Bengaluru after their win against NorthEast United in Shillong last week, but they showed no signs of real fatigue throughout the game, as they put pressure on Chennaiyin, and defended stubbornly when they had to, to ensure Owen Coyle's team have nothing but pride and league position left to play for in their final two games of the season - both at home in Chennai.\nThe decisive moment in the game came through a superb set-piece. Alberto Noguera floated the ball over to the back-post, where Bheke was unmarked. He still had a lot of work to do, though, but met the ball sweetly on the half volley to put it into the top corner, giving Mohammad Nawaz no chance in goal.\nChennaiyin had two massive opportunities to score, one in either half. Wilmar Jordan missed a free header from point-blank range, and then in the last few minutes of the game, Daniel Chima Chukwu should've scored after controlling the ball around the six yard box, but somehow skewed his shot wide.",

        "headline": "ISL playoffs scenarios: 10 teams still in with a chance for top 6",
        "body": "The 2024-25 ISL season has reached its business end, with around a month of league stage fixtures left before the playoffs commence in mid-March.\nIt has been a competitive season, as this league always seems to produce. As it stands, the 13 teams have all played at least 19 of their allotted 24 league games, and only Mohammedan SC are out of contention for the playoffs. MSC have only managed 11 points from 19 games, in what has turned into a troubled debut ISL campaign.\nFor the other 12 teams, there is all to play for in the next month, although that could change for a couple of teams, who need more than just a miracle for them to make it to the playoffs. Here's how each team stands at the moment, and their potential route to the playoffs:\nCurrent Points: 52 in 22 games\nGoal Difference: +29\nA perfect, record-breaking campaign has seen Mohun Bagan become the first team to defend the League Shield title - after a last-gasp win over Odisha FC courtesy Dimi Petratos. Their last two games have become little more than formalities.\nRemaining Matches: Mumbai City (A), FC Goa (H)\nCurrent Points: 44 in 22 games\nGoal Difference: +16\nA month or so ago, FC Goa fans may have looked at that last league away to Bagan as a shield-decider, but Bagan have just been way too good. The shield is gone for Goa, but their remaining games are no less important. They will love to finish second in the league, but also Marquez knows that his side cannot lose momentum before they go into the playoffs.\nRemaining Matches: Mohammedan SC (H), Mohun Bagan (A)\nCurrent Points: 37 in 21 games\nGoal Difference: -2\nJust a couple of weeks ago, there was a thought that Jamshedpur could be the ones to really push Bagan for the shield. Losses to Hyderabad, Bengaluru and NorthEast United have snuffed that thought out. However, they have taken a step closer to making it to the playoffs after beating Mohammedan SC 2-0. Bagan's win over Odisha also saw Jamshedpur qualify for the playoffs.\nRemaining Matches: Kerala Blasters (A), Odisha FC (H), Chennaiyin FC (A)\nCurrent Points: 37 in 22 games\nGoal Difference: +11\nThat win against Jamshedpur at the Kanteerava came at the perfect time for Bengaluru. They'd gotten just a point from six games before that one, so it was a significant result against a team above them on the table. And then they went on to defeat NorthEast United 2-0 and Chennaiyin FC 1-0 which confirmed their place in the playoffs.\nRemaining Matches: East Bengal (A), Mumbai City FC (H)\nCurrent Points: 32 in 22 games\nGoal Difference: +10\nHow far could they have dreamt if they somehow found some steel and solidity to complement the phenom that Alaaeddine Ajaraie has been this season? The Moroccan has had arguably the greatest individual season in ISL history - and that deserved to be fighting for bigger honours rather than clinging on to a playoff spot. The loss against Bengaluru made it tricky for NorthEast, but positive results against sides below them should do the job.\nRemaining Matches: Chennaiyin FC (A), East Bengal (H)\nCurrent Points: 32 in 21 games\nGoal Difference: 0\nMumbai City have struggled to score goals all season. Only the bottom three have scored fewer than them. However, only Mohun Bagan have conceded less than they have. They've got tough games coming up, as Bagan visit Mumbai before trips to Kochi and Bengaluru. The goalless draw against Hyderabad looked to have put a secure top 6 spot into a precarious position.\nRemaining Matches: Mohun Bagan (H), Kerala Blasters (A), Bengaluru FC (A)\nCurrent Points: 29 in 22 games\nGoal Difference: +7\nTheir season has been a peculiar one, but not particularly difficult to describe. The average age of their foreigners has caught up with them this season. This hasn't been the lively, attacking Sergio Lobera side we've seen for years in the ISL and that drop in pace and intensity has been seen in their results. They're by no means out of contention, but the loss to Bagan has dented most of their hopes.\nRemaining Matches: Mohammedan SC (H), Jamshedpur FC (A)\nCurrent Points: 27 in 22 games\nGoal Difference: -2\nAt no point in this season has it felt like East Bengal have ever clearly threatened the top six positions. The possibility now is mathematical, but they need a miracle. They need to win both their remaining games, and hope for monumental slips from multiple teams above them. It is very likely that their wait for a first ISL playoff appearance is likely to continue for another season at least.\nRemaining Matches: Bengaluru FC (H), NorthEast United (A)\nCurrent Points: 24 in 22 games\nGoal Difference: -3\nLast season's excellent playoff run and what looked like a good summer transfer window hasn't translated to on-pitch results for Owen Coyle and Chennaiyin. They only recently broke a seven-match winless run - one in which they let multiple winning positions slip. They will live to regret those games against Mohammedan away and Odisha at home, come the end of the season. Wins in those instead of draws would've just left four points off sixth place right now, instead of the eight points they find themselves behind by.\nRemaining Matches: NorthEast United (H), Jamshedpur FC (H)\nCurrent Points: 24 in 21 games\nGoal Difference: -5\nThe chance they'd given themselves seems to be slipping away, and a 2-0 loss to Goa means they drop to tenth.  It's going to be a tough run-in for the Blasters. That away game in Hyderabad is a good chance to get three points, but they'll need to produce some big results before that for that game to be of any consequence.\nRemaining Matches: Jamshedpur FC (H), Mumbai City FC (H), Hyderabad FC (A)\nCurrent Points: 24 in 22 games\nGoal Difference: -6\nA season that began so promisingly for Punjab has gone a little pear-shaped and now they really don't have much momentum on their side, with three games to go. They're still very much in the race mathematically but will need other results to go in their favour.\nRemaining Matches: Hyderabad FC (A), Mohammedan SC (A)\nCurrent Points: 17 in 22 games\nGoal Difference: -23\nIt's been a tough season for Hyderabad, even if it has been better than last season. They've had their moments, like the win away in Kerala and at home against Jamshedpur. NorthEast's win over Jamshedpur and their loss to Odisha saw them drop out of contention for the playoff spots.\nRemaining Matches: Punjab FC (H), Kerala Blasters (H)",

        "headline": "Ibrahim Zadran goes from staid to spectacular to finish England off",
        "body": "Ibrahim Zadranwalked over to the practice nets, probably wondering what he was doing in Greater Noida. Afghanistan were supposed to be two days into a Test match against New Zealand, and the toss was yet to happen. Even his presence on these practice pitches was downright dangerous, the top layer of soil underfoot was unstable, every step presenting a hazard. Like a horror movie cliché where the jump scare is foreshadowed by an extended period of disquieting dread, what he feared happened. His ankle sank into the slush and turned over; it would be nearly four months before he played again. Seriously, what was he doing out here?\nThat question took on a slightly different tone half-an-hour into Afghanistan's 'eliminator' against England in Lahore. The crowd was beginning to fill up and, unlike England's game against Australia here at the Gaddafi Stadium, they knew precisely what they wanted. The sea of Afghan flags left little doubt.\nBut, and Zadran will know this, few who tune in to watch an Afghan innings from the first ball do it to watch him bat. But Rahmanullah Gurbaz had been sent back early after England muffled him with hard lengths in the first four overs before Jofra Archer punished him for static feet by going full and cleaning him up.\nIt was the sixth over, and Zadran had managed two runs. Afghanistan's faith in him had shown no signs of wavering but Zadran's form hadn't been helped by the enforced injury layoff. No half-century in nine white-ball games and, despite six of them being T20s, just one innings where he scored at better than a run-a-ball. With two off 14 balls, this was very much an innings in his recent mould.\nMark Wood fired another one into the pitch, and Zadran deflected this away to third, perhaps too close to third. Archer, who against Australia crucially put down Alex Carey midway through a crucial chase, didn't put in the dive that perhaps would have made the distance, and watched the ball sail over for six. The following over, Archer, perhaps catalysed at ceding that half-chance, went full and fast at him. Zadran lashed one away through the off side, before creaming a straight drive past mid-off. When Archer banged it in again, he just dropped his hands.\nPerhaps it's because he opens with Gurbaz, but Afghanistan don't need Zadran to come out flying. His strike rate in the low 80s is positively quaint by modern standards; just four of his 34 innings before today had come at better than a run-a-ball. His shot-making repertoire, too, is conventional; runs behind the wicket likely coming via glances rather than scoops, boundaries to backward point the product of late cuts and not reverse sweeps.\nDismissals after brief starts do look especially damning. WhenKagiso Rabada cleaned him upon Friday off his 29th delivery, Zadran had scored just 17. The two warm-up ODIs against New Zealand and the Pakistan Shaheens side saw him score 32 off 49 and 39 off 55; Afghanistan lost both those games.\nEarly aggression doesn't necessarily come naturally to him, but with three wickets down in the first nine, it wasn't what Afghanistan needed, either. The 17 balls following those dual Archer boundaries, Zadran scored just six runs as England reverted to the hard lengths that come to bowlers for whom swing is not a primary weapon. By the halfway mark of the innings, Zadran's half-century had come up, but it took him 67 balls for his 52; Afghanistan's 103 in 25 saw them hit just six fours, the lowest for any innings at this Champions Trophy. Against balls pitched on a good length or back of it by that stage, Zadran managed just 7 runs in 23 balls.\nHaving laid anchor for half the innings, Zadran had the confidence to know he could be around to round off the other half. He might argue that the restrained nature of his innings simply boiled down to a refusal to force the issue with false shots. On the handful of occasions the quicks went full in this period, Zadran helped himself to 16 off 12. \"I was trying to take time and work on my basics,\" he said later. \"I always try to keep it simple.\"\nHe was all praise for Afghanistan coach Jonathan Trott too\nIt is exactly how Zadran made it look when Jamie Overton returned to the attack and he decided it was time to cash his investment in. Overton began full and was punished by a boundary, and tried to go back to the shorter ball. But, 27 overs in, Zadran began to unleash, kicking into the next phase of his innings with a scythe over long-off. With an injury to Wood reducing his effectiveness, England were forced to turn to Liam Livingstone and Joe Root for a combined 12 overs, and against the belligerence of the incoming Mohammad Nabi and Azmatullah Omarzai, even Adil Rashid's impact was limited.\nThreading it all together was Zadran, who nudged his way to three figures off 106 deliveries, and, for someone who it can sometimes feel hides away behind Gurbaz, left England few hiding places. Four days earlier, Ben Duckett appeared to be fading badly towards the end of an epic innings of his own; England did not run a single two between the start of the 41st over till Duckett got out in the 48th, and the big launch at the death never arrived. England scored 42 runs in 38 balls from the start of the final powerplay to Duckett's dismissal.\nBut Zadran, having played a leading role as innings anchor, was the main character for the big finish, too. A pick-up shot off an Archer slower ball that disappeared to midwicket was perhaps the shot of the game; Afghanistan coach Jonathan Trott was still swooning about it four hours later in the press room. Archer kept going full and wide, and Zadran honed in on point; 20 came off the over. Two overs later, against a crowd electrified by the onslaught, he sprinted for four twos in the 47th over, running England ragged. Another 113 came off the final ten overs, and in the end, just about every one of those were required to prevent Zadran's heroic effort going in vain.\nEngland, in truth, did make it easy for him. Zadran has made no effort to conceal he prefers the classical shots over the modern, and yet England peppered him full, and got peppered right back; 18 full deliveries in the final half of the innings to Zadran yielded 49 runs. It has been accused of being a same-y bowling attack, and Zadran was ensuring it got same-y results.\nMany players who score big tend to go off the field in the second innings, but Zadran was out there right until the 599th ball of the match, when Rashid launched Omarzai into the Lahore night. Zadran, whose legs never gave up on him, got into position to finish off what he'd started, and finish England off in another ICC ODI tournament.\nThe build-up to this game had focused on whether England should turn up for the match. While Zadran was at his destructive best, there was a sense they didn't after all.",

        "headline": "Why the Luka Dončić trade could define a generation -- for the Mavericks, Lakers and the NBA",
        "body": "NICO HARRISON WOREthe kind of suit no one could miss. Electric blue is probably the best way to describe it. And for 10 minutes, theDallas Mavericksgeneral manager stood at midcourt, 15 feet away from the generational superstar he'd traded to theLos Angeles Lakersa little over three weeks ago, and let himself be seen.\nIfLuka Dončićhad anything to say to the executive who had upended his career -- and the NBA -- with one of the most shocking trades in league history, this was the moment.\nThousands of fans and media members were already inside Crypto.com Arena on Tuesday night, bearing witness to the scene. The vast majority of them pulled out cellphones to document it. Dončić on the Lakers' side of the court, going through his pregame warmups. Harrison at midcourt, leaning against the scorer's table.\nDončić did not look up or acknowledge Harrison once. Not during warmups. Not during the game, when Harrison sat right behind the Mavericks' bench. And not after the game, when he was asked about it.\n\"I didn't see him,\" Dončić said with derision that would've made Don Draper proud.\nThe most game-changing trade in NBA historywas a public and private repudiation of one of the best players in the world -- of his work habits, of the culture he reportedly sets, of his future as a top player in basketball. Those close to him say he has alternated between shock, sadness and angerin the weeks since the trade. Every day that he goes home to the Los Angeles hotel he's living in with his fiancée and young daughter is a reminder of how much his life has been upended.\nThis trade is a defining moment for everyone involved -- for the Mavericks, for Harrison, for the Lakers -- but especially for Dončić. What happens over the next 26 regular-season games will begin to shape their legacies and the league for the next generation.\n\"Great ones have been traded,\" Mavericks coach Jason Kidd said before the game. \"When you look at others that have been traded, they keep moving on. Yes, you're going to be mad. Everyone's human. ... But you can be traded or you could be cut. How you respond after that is what everybody wants to see, and I truly believe Luka's going to be fine.\"\nStill, even Dončić admitted he has never experienced rejection like this before.\n\"The closure is going to take a while, I think,\" Dončić saidafter the Lakers' 107-99 win.\"It's not ideal.\"\nTHAT PROCESS HITits first milestone Tuesday night.\n\"I'm glad this game is over,\" Dončić said. \"There was a lot of emotions. But we go little by little, and every day is better.\"\nAll times Eastern\n\nWednesday, Feb. 2676ers at Knicks, 7 p.m.Spurs at Rockets, 9:30 p.m.\nFriday, Feb. 28Cavaliers at Celtics, 7:30 p.m.Clippers at Lakers, 10 p.m.\nSaturday, March 1Warriors at 76ers, 8:30 p.m. (ABC)\nFor Dončić, facing the Mavericks was an opportunity to face the people and organization that had spurned him. For the Lakers, it was an opportunity to embrace and support their new star at a difficult moment.\n\"I think the best teacher in life is experience,\" LeBron said. \"When you first start off you're not great, but that's your aspiration, that's your goal. You want to become great, but you have to go through adverse moments.\"\nFor Harrison and Kidd, whom Dončić also pointedly did not acknowledge or embrace, it was a moment to stand behind the decision and take whatever scorn or response Dončić had for them.\nOn this night, Dončić chose to ignore them and anyone else who could be regarded as culpable for trading him. He would let his play speak for him: a 19-point, 15-rebound, 12-assist triple-double, his first as a Laker.\n\"I'm just glad it's over, honestly,\" Dončić said. \"It was just so weird, the moments. Felt like I didn't know what I was doing.\"\nKyrie Irvinghas stayed in touch with Dončić since the trade, checking on his emotional state more than anything. He feels protective of Dončić.\n\"I don't think he expected the change, and I think that's probably what leads to him feeling his emotions even more so in a deeper way,\" Irving said. \"Rejection, I think that's a strong word ... but sometimes it can feel like that.\n\"You got to go through your process of grieving. Grieving ... is not a word we use in NBA circles -- it's like, 'Just be tough, bro.' Everybody expects you to turn over the next page and get over it. The reality is, man, we're human too.\"\nEventually, Dončić will either move forward -- or he won't. Those close to him are working to help him do so sooner rather than later.\nHOURS BEFORE TIPOFFTuesday night, Nike posted an ad in which a purple Regera changes its No. 77 license plates from Texas to California plates. The soundtrack is George Strait's hit \"All My Ex's Live In Texas.\" The tagline is \"Full Tank, No Mercy.\" Nike also used Tuesday's stage to roll out a new ad campaign for the release of his Luka 4s.\nBefore the game, that purple Regera pulled up outside of Crypto.com Arena to complete the spectacle.\nThis kind of rollout would only happen in Los Angeles, and after the trade, the stage was set for a massive Hollywood debut.\nDončić has already begun to signal he will eventually embrace all that comes along with the stage in the NBA's glamour market. First, by donating $500,000 for wildfire recovery in Los Angeles. Then, Tuesday, by buying up a parking lot across the arena and offering free parking for fans on a first-come, first-served basis.\nThese are early, positive signs that Dončić's future is in Los Angeles, even though he has the ability to become a free agent in 2026 and is no longer eligible to sign the massive five-year, $345 million supermax contract he could have received in Dallas. The Lakers can offer him a four-year, $229 million extension this summer, or, like other teams, a five-year, $296 million contract next summer.\nYes, the franchise will have to surround him with talent, a task the Mavericks struggled for five years to achieve and one that will only get harder whenJameseventually retires. And yes, the quickness with which he and James build their partnership on and off the court matters.\nEvery game is a microcosm of the pressure and challenge of integrating two such similar players, and the unique type of basketball brilliance this partnership can create. There are times when James and Dončić seem to be taking turns initiating the offense, much like James' early days with Dwyane Wade in Miami. Then there are times when they look like they've been playing a two-man game for a decade.\nThere are stretches, like the fourth quarter of a loss to Charlotte last week, when Dončić looked like a defensive liability and out of shape -- confirmation of the criticisms the NBA world heard after the trade. And then there have been games, such as Sunday's win over theDenver Nuggets, when Dončić has looked like the best player in the world, one who can conjure magic on the court and lift a franchise to a championship.\nFormer Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, who sat courtside in a pair of Luka 1 shoes to Tuesday's game, took in the absurdity of the moment.\nEach time Dončić touched the ball, Cuban made a show of booing him. At one point, Dončić turned to Cuban, smiled and said, \"Shut up, Mark.\"\nBut when asked by ESPN's Tim MacMahon what it was like to root against Dončić, Cuban said, \"I hated it.\"",

        "body": "Today is Pokemon Day, the annual celebration of the original Pokemon games--Red and Green--releasing in Japan. With it comes a newPokemon Presents video, and today's ended with a new look at Pokemon Legends: Z-A, along with a release window of \"late 2025.\"\nPokemon Z-A will take Trainers on a tour of Lumiose City, the bustling Paris-themed city from Pokemon X and Y's Kalos region, which in this game is undergoing a \"high-tech urban redevelopment\" by a company called Quasartico for both people and Pokemon to enjoy. The city will feature multiple open areas for exploration, including rooftops--which players can jump off and glide back down to the ground--and Wild Zones where new Pokemon can be battled and caught.\nWe see multiple Pokemon encounters during the trailer, some of which resemble the turn-based battling featured in many previous games, as well as the \"throw a Poke Ball without battling\" mechanic seen in Legends: Arceus. Along with those came a new type of battling system where distance and movement play a key role, as attack moves have a certain amount of reach, and moving a Pokemon out of the way will cause the attack to miss.\nPokemon Legends Z-A will also mark the return of Mega Evolutions--which originated in Pokemon X and Y for the Nintendo DS. Multiple Mega Pokemon are shown in the trailer, including Mega Lucario, Mega Ampharos, and Mega Kangaskhan. We also get a look atLegends Z-A's starters.\nThe trailer also introduced many of the characters inhabiting this version of Lumiose City, which include both new and returning faces. We see the player character's friends Urbain and Taunie, Quasartico CEO Jett and her bodyguard Vinnie, and the return of AZ--the mysterious former king of Kalos--as the owner of the hotel the player-characters stays in during the game.\nPokemon Legends Z-A is the second installment of the Pokemon Legends franchise, as it follows 2022's Pokemon Legends: Arceus. It is scheduled to release in late 2025.",

For anyone looking to finally check it out, people have raved about the vibrant land of Thedas in this game, the colorful cast of characters, and satisfying combat mechanics.\nOn the retro side,Sonic Colors: Ultimateis a great game for fans of Sega's Blue Blur.

        "headline": "Steam Next Fest February 2025: 30 Of The Best Demos You Can Download Right Now",
        "body": "GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\nWe're headed into a busy part of the gaming calendar, and while there are a ton of new releases that'll be competing for your attentionandyour wallet, you can also look forward to an all-you-can-play buffet of demos duringSteam Next Fest. Live now and running through March 3, several of these demos will be time-limited and only available during this brief window, so you’ll want to play them as soon as you can.\nWith that in mind, we've tried to highlight a number of games with demos worth checking out while they're available. This is just a small sampling of the best demos in the Next Fest; be sure to call out any others in the comments below.\nAs a reminder, Next Fest is one of several events planned for 2025. Valve has confirmed the dates for several more gaming festivals that'll be hosted on Steam, as well as upcoming sales. Here's a quick rundown of what you can expect after Next Fest concludes:\nIt feels like we're in a new golden age of platformers, and Demon Tides looks set to be another fun entry in the genre. It looks like Super Mario Sunshine if it were designed by late Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama, and the full game will feature a seamless world to explore while making use of a deep move-set.\nDescribed as a survival-horror game inspired by the best of the genre, Post Trauma is all about solving fiendishly clever puzzles while also exploring a twisted reality full of nightmarish creatures. As Roman, a train conductor stuck in a world full of monsters, you’ll have to choose when to fight and when to flee from the dark creatures hunting you.\nSoccer is a popular sport enjoyed by millions worldwide, but can it be improved? Developer Chamo Games certainly thinks so, and Vector Strike is an interesting proof of concept for how double-jumps, wallrunning, and explosive telekinetic powers can make soccer even more exciting.\nA dynamic 5v5 tactical-shooter, the game formerly known as Project ARC is now PUBG: Blindspot. Not only do you have to contend with other well-armed players in cramped corridors, you have to outwit them by playing as a team and making use of shared strategic resources to triumph.\nIt has been a hot minute since THQ Nordic had any new details on its upcoming remake of 2001's Gothic, but it looks like fans of the old-school RPG will be able to experience a new demo of the game for themselves during Next Fest. We're still not certain what to expect from this fantasy RPG, but back in 2021, Barcelona-based developer Alkimia Interactive did say that it wasaiming to create a high-quality experiencefor fans of the Gothic series.\nLovecraftian horror meets Papers, Please, Static Dread places you inside of an ancient lighthouse and tasks you with keeping the beacon lit so that ships can find safe passage through the dark tides. Each night will have new horrors waiting for the lighthouse keeper, and it's only a matter of time before he falls victim to the Eldritch terrors that have consumed the world.\nThis occult card-crafting narrative-RPG sees a team of investigators explore a haunted mansion, and as one of them, you'll have to explore what really happened to the Ackeron family. The full game will offer several unique characters to play as--Mechanist, Plague Doctor, and Scholar--a non-linear crafting system, and plenty of dread as it's inspired by the works of HP Lovecraft, Edgar Allen Poe, and Bram Stoker.\nFor something less suspenseful, you can check out this charming Stardew Valley-inspired game. Cattle Country invites you to explore a new frontier, as you'll get to make a home in the mountains, take on bandits, and build your own farm. As you'd expect, you'll also get to venture into a nearby town where you can make friends with the locals or enjoy more slice-of-life activities.\nGrappling hooks remain one of the coolest things to have in video games, and in Lost Skies, you'll get to use that humble mode of travel to swing between various islands and explore some ancient architecture. While there's more to the game--from survival elements to co-op for up to six players--it's the freedom to seamlessly traverse the world with a selection of skyships and tools that looks like it'll be a big draw for Lost Skies.\nDeveloper Trigger Happy Interactive had a heck of a debut in 2023 with its neon-soaked boomer-shooter Turbo Overkill, but for the studio's next project, it looks like horror and good ol' ultraviolence is on the menu. Set in the spooky locale of Fort Oasis, Total Chaos pits you against various monsters, and you'll need to scavenge for resources that you can use to craft weapons that can help you survive against these nightmarish and relentless foes.\nA survival game set in the American West, Hauntsville is all about setting up your very own homestead during a pivotal period in American history and then fighting to protect it from monsters that emerge at night. The game features dynamic systems to keep you on your toes, and with an authentic eye for detail, it's also a history lesson for the ages when you're not unloading some iron into the torso of a homicidal monster.\nAn answer to one of the oldest questions that has plagued mankind over the centuries, Is This Seat Taken is a charming little puzzle game where you get to play matchmaker. It's a game that's all about putting people in the right seat, as you'll have to do some human-organizing across crowded buses, bustling cinemas, and other levels where space is at a premium.\nIf you've considered an escape from the rat race, then there's a pretty good chance that you've eyed a few ads for camper vans. They are a bit on the expensive side, but fortunately, you can own a digital version of that classic ride in Camper Van: Make It Home. Another game full of organizational puzzles, you'll get to customize the interior of your dream home-on-wheels before you set off on a reflective journey to help recharge your soul.\nThe first Everhood game in 2021 was wonderfully weird, and naturally, its upcoming sequel is looking to crank up the bizarre factor to 11. Billed as an \"unconventional ARPG\" with rhythmic combat, the full game will have over 100 musical tracks for you to battle across and trippy visuals to complement its strange story.\nA hero-focused turn-based RPG set in a dystopian underground world, Fumehead will let you take control of the characters Jack and Ami as they face off against an alien disease that has begun to corrupt their world. If you're a fan of RPGs with complex gameplay systems, then Fumehead might satisfy your hunger for a deep tactical-RPG experience.\nSet in a far-flung corner of the galaxy, Empyreal is an action-RPG that features a complex combat system and formidable foes to test your skills out on. The full game will offer customizable characters, tons of weapons, and an ancient world to explore.\nThere's a thrill to be had in games that feature destruction physics, and Deliver At All Costs looks like a fun take on the delivery genre. As the go-to driver in the town of St Monique, you'll need to deliver all kinds of packages to their destinations as quickly as possible and without asking too many questions. Set in 1959 as the Cold War starts to heat up, you can expect to cause plenty of destruction and deal with the consequences later. Sure, the local fuzz might want to lock you up after your attempt to Tokyo-drift through a store brought the whole joint down, but at least you got your package to its destination in time!\nCity-building games can be exciting, especially when you've managed to craft a metropolis that runs like clockwork even when you're not taking an active hand in its development. The King is Watching puts an interesting twist on that idea, as not only will you have to run a kingdom, but you'll have to keep an eye on your local peasants to make sure that they're not slacking off. Every system is interconnected, and with its minimalist design, it looks like a fascinating dip into ye olde medieval management.\n2D run-and-gun games are as popular as they used to be, but every so often a new entry in the genre pops around to grab your attention. Nitro Express doesn't look complicated, but it does look cathartic thanks to its anime-inspired art direction, legions of enemies, and an arsenal of weapons to master.\nAnyone looking to jump into a digital toybox can check out the demo for A-RED: Walking Robot during Next Fest, as this looks like a fun combination of puzzles and obstacle courses. It's up to you to pilot a cute little wind-up robot through these levels, as you'll race against the clock to get the little mechanical fella through each stage.\nWartorn has a great elevator pitch, as this game is a fusion of real-time tactics and roguelite influences. As you'd expect, you'll need to put together a team of talented spellcasters to take on the forces of darkness, pay careful attention to the ever-shifting battlefield, and make use of squad combos to emerge victorious.\nSure, your spaceship might look like a Windows 95 mouse cursor going through a Goth phase, but in Hyperslice, that little ship is a force to be reckoned with. After all, why bother with lasers when you can slice through enemies with your spacecraft and turn them into projectiles in turn? A fast-paced roguelike, you'll need quick reflexes and the right upgrades if you want to survive for a lengthy time in Hyperslice's sci-fi arena.\nWildkeepers Rising looks like an interesting new addition to the Survivors-like genre, thanks to an interesting ace up its sleeve to help set it apart from other games in this category: collectible monsters! Imagine Vampire Survivors meets Pokemon, and you'll have a good idea of what to expect here as you'll get to discover and tame powerful creatures that can assist you in battle.\nThe original Monster Train was a big hit, and for the sequel, developer Shiny Shoe is building on that success with new clans, enemy factions, challenges, modes, and more. In case you missed the first game, you can check out the demo that serves as a fun crash-course into this deck-building roguelite ahead of its full release later this year.\nSomething strange is going down in the small town of Ashwood Creek, and as a police officer, it's up to you to figure out this mystery as you journey into the unknown. Radiolight looks like the kind of game that'll keep you on the edge of your seat with its haunting design, and if a constant sense of dread sounds like a good time to you, then you'll want to grab this demo and start exploring the darkness around you. Think fast, run faster, and trust no one in this spooky slice of '80s mystery.\nThe fate of the universe is at stake in Wheel World, a game where you'll get to race across stunning vistas, soak up the scenery, and commune with some friendly ghosts. Along the way, you can scour the land for rare parts to upgrade your eco-friendly wheels, test your skills, and uncover secrets in your quest to save the spirits of Wheel World in this cool-looking cycling simulator.\n\nWe've seen plenty of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle action games over the decades, but Tactical Takedown looks like an interesting spin on the turn-based strategy genre. Not only will you have to carefully measure every move you make, you'll also get to engage in some beat-'em-up action along the way. The game has a Saturday morning cartoon vibe to its design thanks to its comic book visuals, and with I Am Your Beast composer RJ Lake on soundtrack duty, it has a pretty great score as well.\n\nAnother wonderfully strange game to check out is Skin Deep, a first-person shooter with roguelike elements. While that sounds like a familiar combo of genres, Skin Deep dials up the absurdity with its oddball comedy, blocky space-cat employers that you'll have to answer to, and interesting gameplay mechanics revolving around sneezing and controlling your body odor.\n\nIf the devil is such a jerk, then why is he allowed to walk around free as a bird? That's the question you'll get to answer in Shotgun Cop Man, a new game from My Friend Pedro developer Dead Toast Entertainment. You've got minimalist visuals, demons who want to get in your way, and Satan dropping F-bombs as you break the laws of physics in this platformer. There's no jump button, but there is a copious amount of ammo as you use your shotgun to bounce around stages as you pursue the devil himself.\nCommand and Conquer is on an indefinite break, but the next best thing for real-time strategy fans might just be Tempest Rising. Inspired by the RTS greats of a bygone era, it's a good-looking strategy game set in an alternate timeline where the Cold War got hot thanks to nuclear warfare and two major factions are duking it out over a new resource. If you still have fond memories for the golden Westwood age of RTS titles, you might want to give this game a go.\n\n",

        "headline": "The Best Nintendo Switch Games In 2025",
        "body": "GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\nAs 2025 begins, it's a good time to catch up on the very best Nintendo Switch games. As you may expect, many of the best Nintendo Switch games are published by Nintendo itself. The vast and impressive library of exclusives has been complemented by a staggering number of third-party hits. With such a strong catalog of games, narrowing down the standouts to the very best isn't super easy, but that's what we've attempted with our list of the best Nintendo Switch games. These are our absolute highest recommendations.\nOur list includes a smattering of games you can only play on Nintendo Switch as well as some third-party titles that feel right at home on the console. If your favorite Switch game didn't make the cut, just know that this list could easily include 50-plus games. We aimed to include a mix of genres, franchises, and both AAA and indie games. Essentially, this list can be used as a guide for a good place to start if you just joined the Nintendo Switch club. Though some franchises nabbed multiple spots on this list (Zelda, Metroid, Pokemon), we tried to limit repetition where possible. And now that Nintendo has officially announced that itsSwitch successor announcementis coming within the next year, so this may be the last year of the original Switch being the company's primary focus.\nOur picks are organized in alphabetical order, and at the bottom of this list, you'll find a note detailing which games have been removed .\nEditor's Note: Article updated on January 3, 2025.\nAnimal Crossing: New Horizons remains one of the most popular and wholesome games on Nintendo Switch. Just as lockdowns began happening across the world, Animal Crossing: New Horizons invited players to a tranquil island for a relaxing loop of activities like fishing, bug-catching, and perfecting the layout of their virtual homes. Nintendo has steadily introduced new features to New Horizons, including plenty of free content as well as the massive Happy Home Paradise DLC.\nNew Horizons also has robust customization features, including a new terraforming feature that gives you complete control over the terrain of your island. Whether you're conversing with your fellow residents, trying to finish your museum catalog, or visiting your friends' islands, Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a constant charmer.\nRead ourAnimal Crossing: New Horizons review.\nThe metroidvania genre has become so common that even some great ones can at times feel predictable or even formulaic. Animal Well sets itself apart by deemphasizing combat in favor of clever puzzle-solving and a tightly crafted, intricate world. The dark world has a low-fi aesthetic that doesn't look quite like anything else, and as you progress through it you'll find all sorts of strange household objects and toys that open up the world in surprising ways. The map is small but densely packed with secrets to uncover and small interactions to discover, making for a surprisingly refreshing take on the genre. And it's a perfect fit for the Switch's portability, letting you hold the inviting world of Animal Well in your hands.\nRead ourAnimal Well review.\nA showstopper of confident combat and demonic dance-moves, Bayonetta 3 gets action in a way that few other games do. A cocky blast of fun that caps the Bayonetta trilogy off on a high note, Bayonetta 3 isn't afraid to mix up its formula with the arrival of a new character who's a perfect contrast to the elegant anarchy of the titular witch. With a multi-dimensional storyline, full-scale kaiju battles, and even a Hollywood-level chase sequence, Bayonetta 3 doesn't forget why fans fell in love with the series in the first place.\nRead ourBayonetta 3 review.\nA wonderful platformer with an important message, Celeste feels right at home on Nintendo Switch. Madeline makes the trip to the treacherous Mount Celeste, a snow-covered mountain filled with perilous cliffs and interesting characters. Rendered in gorgeous pixelated graphics, Celeste plays like an old-school platformer and relies largely on well-timed jumps. It feels superb in motion, and the level design gradually grows more challenging as you acquire new abilities that cleverly expand the gameplay. It's a difficult game, but you can tweak the settings to fit your skill level to enjoy the story. Celeste tells a moving tale about finding yourself and overcoming self-doubt that creeps into your mind. It's one of the most poignant games in recent years as well as one of the best side-scrolling platformers on Switch.\nSee ourCeleste review.\nStudio MDHR's Cuphead is a glorious ode to classic cartoons and a tremendous run-and-gun. Cuphead originally released for Xbox One and PC before being ported to Nintendo Switch. It made a smooth transition and runs flawlessly on the Switch hardware whether you're playing on your TV or in handheld mode. Cuphead's art style immediately stands out. The hand-drawn characters and animations look ripped out of a 1930s cartoon, giving Cuphead a visual style that will always look great. The jazzy audio design rounds out the presentation, transporting players to a different time. Essentially, it's a playable cartoon.\nCuphead is far more than just a beautiful artistic triumph; it's also an aptly designed run-and-gun filled with exciting boss fights and cleverly made side-scrolling levels. If you're not afraid of a challenge, Cuphead is an absolute must-play game whether you play solo or cooperatively with a friend. The Delicious Last Course expansion only added to Cuphead's greatness by offering a brand-new playable character and some of the most impressive boss fights and animations across the whole package.\nSee ourCupheadandCuphead DLC reviews.\nDead Cells is an amalgamation of rogue-likes and metroidvanias, and the result is an influential game that will likely be considered one of the best inbothgenres for years to come. Set in a procedurally generated castle, you play as a reanimated mass of cells taking hold of a prisoner's body. The labyrinthine castle is crawling with dangerous enemies and littered with secrets waiting to be uncovered. Each time you die--which tends to happen fairly regularly--you have to start over again. Critically, there are permanent upgrades, which allow you to make progress and see new areas with each subsequent run.\nWith finely tuned and stylish action combat, an array of cool abilities and weapons, and an expertly designed map that changes each time you play, Dead Cells compels you to see it through to the end. And like all good roguelikes, Dead Cells makes you want to play through it again and again. Dead Cells has a bunch of great add-on content, including a great Castlevania-themed DLC, which really does feel like a perfect pairing.\nRead ourDead Cells review.\nIt's something of a miracle that Divinity: Original Sin 2 plays so well on Nintendo Switch. While the resolution is worse than on other platforms, particularly in handheld mode, Original Sin 2 runs well. The massive turn-based CRPG from Larian Studios is a modern masterpiece in the genre, featuring a stunning fantasy world, rich writing, and a combat system with consummate depth. If you're looking for an old-school CRPG to play at home or on the go, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is one of your best bets. It's big and bold and manages to offer surprises and new layers even after dozens of hours of play.\nRead ourDivinity: Original Sin 2 review.\nOne of the most influential RPGs of all time has finally gotten the glow-up it deserves. Dragon Quest III was an incredible, genre-defining classic in its day, helping to break new ground with innovations like a robust job system and party recruiting. The HD-2D Remake recontextualizes this in the retro-modern aesthetic of games like Octopath Traveler or Triangle Strategy. The gameplay is faithful to the original, while packing just enough quality-of-life enhancements to make it smoother for current day play. It's the best way to enjoy a true classic.\nRead ourDragon Quest III HD-2D Remake.\nSquare Enix's long-running Dragon Quest franchise has consistently stuck to its roots, and Dragon Quest 11 embraces its traditional JRPG identity. In an age where more and more JRPGs are injecting traditionally Western gameplay features into their systems, Dragon Quest 11 embraces what it has always done so well. It's simply a fantastic turn-based role-playing game filled with charming characters, a beautiful world, and a deeply satisfying combat system. On Switch, you can switch between two distinct styles: modern 3D visuals and a classic 8-bit top-down presentation. The latter is especially intriguing for handheld mode.\nRead ourDragon Quest 11 review.\nRelentlessly engaging and rife with variety, Fire Emblem: Three Houses is the most impressive entry in the beloved strategy series. You play as a professor who oversees one of three houses at a mysterious monastery. There, you cultivate relationships and train your students to be prepared for the battles ahead. While recent Fire Emblem games have leaned more into social simulation, Three Houses takes this concept to the next level and includes some well-implemented management sim features. It strikes a wonderful balance between storytelling, preparation for the next battle, and the always-wonderful tactical combat scenarios the series is known for. With deftly written characters, an exceedingly good tale, and smart tweaks to the layered combat system, Fire Emblem: Three Houses is an astonishing experience from start to finish. And more than any other Fire Emblem game before it, Three Houses encourages multiple playthroughs to see the whole story, and each playthrough is different.\nRead ourFire Emblem: Three Houses review.\nThough escaping the Underworld is the goal in Hades, being sent back to it after each failed run isn't a bad consolation prize. Hades, more than any other roguelike before it, intertwines its fast-paced action gameplay with its exquisite story in such a way that failure can be a good thing. You play as Hades' son Zagreus, a charismatic hero in his own right, but it's the supporting cast and all of their own interpersonal tales that make Hades such an enriching experience. Each attempt to escape the Underworld is a thrilling pursuit, one that relies on experimentation with your build to find the right balance for you. The combat has more depth than you'd initially expect, and after a few hours of futile escape attempts, Hades really starts to click. Even after you finally escape, Hades has a wonderful endgame that includes new storylines and challenging combat scenarios.\nRead ourHades review.\nIt's a good thing that Hollow Knight is such a good metroidvania that you can comfortably hop into whenever the fancy strikes you, because it makes the wait for its sequel Silksong that much more bearable. The original game had some rough edges, but these were smoothed over in time and the bug's life adventure that came out of this was nothing short of exceptional. Hollow Knight is haunting and elegant: an aggressive collection of combat and exploration that feels right at home on the Switch. This version also contains all of its DLC, a sizable chunk of content that expands on the game massively and is enhanced by its gorgeous visual design.\nRead ourHollow Knight review.\nSubset Games' Into the Breach is a rare type of game that feels and plays like nothing before it. Developed by FTL studio Subset Games, Into the Breach is a roguelike tactics game that takes place on tiny grids. In the distant future, the monstrous Vek are threatening humanity. To save the world from monsters, you assemble a team of three mechs who take on the Vek in small-scale battles on eight-by-eight grids. Each battle only lasts several turns, and the goal isn't to overpower the Vek; instead, you're trying to deter their attacks and limit damage on critical infrastructure. You can also see a preview of each Vek's next move at the start of every turn, allowing you to strategize for the best possible outcome. Into the Breach is more like chess than a traditional tactics game, and you'd be surprised at how involved the matches can get. Into the Breach innovates on the form more than any other game in recent memory.\nSee ourInto the Breach review.\nSimply put, Kirby and the Forgotten Land is the best game in series history. As Kirby's first 3D platforming adventure, Forgotten Land offers remarkable variety and depth compared to earlier entries in the series. Kirby's iconic Copy ability works incredibly well in 3D, adding depth to both puzzles and combat. With six unique worlds that each contain levels that are littered with secrets and novel design quirks, Kirby and the Forgotten is one of those platformers that constantly surprises. Kirby's new Mouthful Mode ability is a charmer and spices up gameplay even more. The lengthy mainline stages are complemented by short and sweet time trials dubbed Treasure Road. These optional levels utilize Kirby's Copy and Mouthful abilities in fun and interesting ways, and completing them feeds into the overall loop that compels you to upgrade Copy abilities to make them even cooler. Kirby and the Forgotten Land is an absolute delight from start to finish whether you're playing solo or alongside a friend or loved one in local co-op.\nRead ourKirby and the Forgotten Land review.\nThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild was a Switch launch title, but it remains one of the best games on the platform all these years later. Many fans have called it the best game in the entire franchise--though the next game on this list has a strong argument, too. Breath of the Wild was Nintendo's first real foray into open-world games, and it's easily one of the best in class. Breath of the Wild provides a sense of exploration never before seen in the series. The sprawling open world of Hyrule is gorgeous and serves as Link’s personal playground. He can climb virtually anything, which creates an incredible sense of scale and freedom. This overarching change extends to the central progression as well. Replacing elaborate dungeons with tons of small-scale Shrines allows you to approach the adventure in your own way. Breath of the Wild is one of the few open-world games that isn't littered with extraneous systems and objectives. It prides itself on offering a slower pace and a more scenic, desolate world that's ripe for exploring, whether you're on foot, horseback, or scaling a cliff searching for a new discovery. Breath of the Wild is a stunning, brilliant adventure.\nRead ourThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild review.\nAfter decades of playing the damsel in distress or a sidekick to Link's heroism, Zelda is now finally taking center stage in her own adventure. Echoes of Wisdom looks remarkably similar to the Link's Awakening remake for Switch, with the same playfully animated aesthetic. But Zelda takes the lead this time with her own distinct mechanics. Using a special wand, she can summon \"Echoes\" of the objects and enemies she encounters, using them to cleverly solve puzzles and fight in combat encounters. While Zelda can take the form of a swordfighter like Link, her combat hooks are different enough to set this game apart and let Zelda forge her own path at last.\nRead ourThe Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom review.\n\nSix years after the release of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Nintendo captured lightning in a bottle again with its sequel, Tears of the Kingdom. Building on the foundation of the groundbreaking Switch launch game, Tears of the Kingdom hits all the right notes for a sequel. It's bigger, bolder, and even more ambitious than the first game, and at the same time, it makes great strides towards addressing some of the more lingering issues from Breath of the Wild.\nThe Legend of Zelda at its very best, Tears of the Kingdom links to the past by borrowing the best elements from older games in the franchise, and delivers a rewarding experience that's endlessly captivating. The end result is a masterpiece of intelligent engineering and fun gameplay that will become a new gold standard for future Zelda games.\nRead ourThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom review.\nWho would have thought that a tag team of Mushroom Kingdom superstars and Ubisoft's Rabbids could produce such a gem? Following up on the absurd strategy of 2017's Kingdom Battle, Sparks of Hope refines the turn-based strategy formula with genuinely clever improvements. It's a game that the rest of the genre should pay attention to, as Ubisoft Milan and Paris make big changes that help create a better game with an even better sense of pacing.\nIt's also just a hoot to play, with the sheer joy woven into every pixel shining in this sequel. From Luigi's barely contained cowardice to the hilarious silliness of the Rabbids, Sparks of Hope is a chaotic but clever little masterpiece on the Switch.\nRead ourMario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope review.\nAn expanded port of the excellent Wii U game, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is the best racing game on Nintendo Switch. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe currently contains more than 40 racers and 48 tracks, including many of the best courses from Mario Kart history. Deluxe adds several notable features, including driving assistance settings for new players and two item slots. It also has an extended Battle mode, which winds up making Mario Kart 8 Deluxe the most content-rich and well-rounded entry in series history. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe released during the Switch's launch window, but it remains one of the most popular multiplayer games on the console for good reason. It should be in every Nintendo Switch owner's library.\nSee ourMario Kart 8 Deluxe review.\nAfter a nearly two-decade wait, Metroid returned to its side-scrolling roots for an adventure that closed out the current Metroid saga. Remarkably, Metroid Dread lives up to the high expectations set by longtime fans. Developed by Mercury Steam (Metroid: Samus Returns), Metroid Dread is a wonderful adventure that sticks to its roots. Dread shines mechanically, with fast-paced combat, a wide range of upgrades to acquire, and a stable of bosses that test your fortitude and counterattack skills. Dread also introduces the EMMI, creepy robots who patrol designated zones and cause instant game overs if you're caught. It's an absolute joy to explore the maze-like locales, and Dread's huge swath of secrets to uncover encourages multiple playthroughs. Metroid Dread is easily one of the best side-scrollers on Switch, and it's a reminder that going back to your roots can be a truly excellent idea.\nRead ourMetroid Dread review.\nFew games stand the test of time, but Metroid Prime is one of the select few titles from a bygone era that still feels as good to play today as it did on the GameCube back in 2002. More than two decades later, it'sevenbetter as this first-person shooter got a massive facelift for Nintendo's hybrid console. Looking better than ever, Samus Aran's shift to the third dimension is a great example of evergreen gameplay design that influenced an entire generation of action games in its wake. It's still Metroid right down to its first-person bones, but the slick action and well-paced exploration can be enjoyed without needing to don some nostalgia-goggles.\nRead ourMetroid Prime Remastered review.\nThe Monster Hunter series has a long history on Nintendo platforms dating back nearly a decade, and though Monster Hunter World didn't release for the Switch, Capcom rectified that with the excellent Monster Hunter Rise. Though it started as a Switch exclusive, Rise has since been ported to other platforms and received a massive DLC, Sunbreak, that makes it all the more enjoyable. Rise adds a level of verticality through the Wirebug tool. Though perfect for shorter gameplay sessions, it also fits comfortably as a mainline entry with a big map, online multiplayer action, and a ton of depth in the various weapon types for players looking to experiment. With a mix of classic monsters and newcomers, it's a great entry pointandperfect for the series' veterans.\nRead ourMonster Hunter Rise review.\nThe Switch has become a hub for classic JRPG goodness, and Octopath Traveler II is a prime example of this. Square Enix's follow-up to the original game retains all the classic charm of the SNES era, mixed with graphics that blur the line between modern and retro gaming. Not just a good-looking game, Octopath Traveler II is satisfying to play thanks to its combo of non-linear storytelling, freeform exploration, and strategic combat, all of which serve to deliver a challenging adventure told across multiple viewpoints.\nLike the best sequels, it builds on the ideas that the original game pioneered, improving and iterating on its unique elements. If you're looking for a cozy JRPG that'll easily consume dozens of your hours, Octopath Traveler II is worth picking up.\nRead ourOctopath Traveler 2 review.\nPerhaps the most beloved of Mario's many RPG incarnations, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door received an excellent and loving remake on Nintendo Switch this year. The bright, colorful visuals look better than ever thanks to an HD remaster, the heartfelt and often funny dialogue still shines through years later, and the turn-based battle system still feels dynamic and incredibly balanced. In addition to remastering a beloved game, a new fast-travel, hint, and training options help streamline the experience and make it more approachable for newcomers. This is the definitive way to experience a classic all over again, or for the first time.\nRead ourPaper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door review.\nAt first glance, The Plucky Squire appears to be another indie Zelda-like, albeit one with a particularly lovely storybook art style. But it takes a turn when the hero of the story is thrown out of his book, and into the real world of a fan's bedroom, by the villain. The adventure then has you jumping in and out of the book at will, manipulating the words on the page, and even opening and closing the book to slide objects around for puzzle-solving. It's an inventive hook with loads of cool applications, and on top of that, The Plucky Squire keeps you on your toes with an impressive level of variety.\nRead ourThe Plucky Squire review.\nPokemon Sword & Shield ushers in the Galar region, an expansive locale filled with new Pokemon and a familiar but refined loop. Once again, you're working to be the best that ever was, starting off with one Pokemon and no badges and slowly working your way to filling out your Pokedex and becoming the Pokemon League Champion. The Galar region has several Wild Areas (including DLC areas), new open sections filled with different species of Pokemon roaming in plain sight. These sections offer a nice change of pace to the streamlined journeys of previous games, and the new Dynamax mechanic and rotating raids add more continuous content to enjoy. With a great collection of new Pokemon, more customization options available at your fingertips, and a wealth of content that only gets more substantial when you factor in the pair of expansions, Pokemon Sword & Shield is a worthy addition to the beloved franchise.\nRead ourPokemon Sword and Shield review.\nPokemon Legends: Arceus sits somewhere between a mainline game and a spin-off. Taking place well before the events of any other RPG entry in the series, Arceus sends players to the Hisui region (Sinnoh) to complete the first Pokedex. Arceus' core gameplay revolves already scouring the land in search of Pokemon, which can be caught by simply lobbing Poke Balls. Arceus also has the familiar turn-based battle system, which makes it feel like a mainline game in many respects. Mainline story missions take place in sprawling areas, which gives Arceus an open-world feel, and with plenty of optional missions as well, Arceus boasts a surprising amount of compelling content. Crafting systems and resource management incentivize exploration, and it's pretty easy to lose hours simply exploring the locales in search of new Pokemon and resources. Pokemon Legends: Arceus is a must-play for Pokemon fans, and even lapsed fans might enjoy the refreshing loop.\nRead ourPokemon Legends: Arceus review.\nThe classic platformer series made a return as a metroidvania, and the results are stellar. This new Prince of Persia revolves around Sargon, the youngest member of a specialized Persian royal guard called the Immortals, who gets caught up in a web of intrigue and betrayal when one of their own kidnaps the kingdom's prince. That leads his band to the mysterious and cursed Mount Qaf, where the adventure takes place.\nWith fine-tuned combat, nail-biting platforming, and excellent new metroidvania quality-of-life features, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is both a leader in its genre and a triumphant return for the classic franchise. It's definitely worth checking out, and the handheld nature of the Switch makes it easy to explore while lounging with your favorite baking show.\nRead ourPrince of Persia: The Lost Crown review.\nThe Shin Megami Tensei mainline series may not be as popular in North America as the Persona series, but JRPG fans shouldn't miss out on Shin Megami Tensei V. This Nintendo Switch exclusive captures the unique atmosphere that the series is known for and complements it with brilliant battles that require players to be strategic with their decisions. The story is a slow burn, but it's filled with interesting characters and choice-driven plot points that make it engaging throughout. If you're looking for a JRPG on Switch that you can sink dozens and dozens of hours into, Shin Megami Tensei V is a great choice--and you don't need to have played previous entries to enjoy it.\nRead ourShin Megami Tensei V review.\nSplatoon 3 isn't as novel an experience the third time around, but this squidtastic game still knows how to make a splash. Family-friendly action in a colorful world, Splatoon 3 refines its formula and creates a highlight reel of fun zone mechanics in online competition, a single-player mode that is delightfully challenging, and clever multiplayer maps.\nWith a massive amount of multiplayer modes and options on offer, Splatoon 3 is a buffet of content that you won't run out of anytime soon. Veterans to the series might need some more convincing before they hop back into familiar territory, but for anyone who has yet to play a Splatoon game, Splatoon 3 is the perfect entry point.\nRead ourSplatoon 3 review.\nTired of the hustle and bustle of city life, you move to your grandfather's farm in Stardew Valley, a picturesque rural community where life moves slower than you're used to. Stardew Valley is both a relaxing farming sim and a wonderful social sim filled with relatable characters. Though it lets you make your own fun, Stardew Valley does have a clever loop that slowly builds as you develop relationships, acquire new gear, and uncover the game's many secrets. It's easy to pour hundreds of hours into Stardew Valley. There's so much to see and do, and after a while, Stardew Valley has the familiarity of home, one that's always a pleasure to return to.\nRead ourStardew Valley review.\nSuper Mario 3D World was one of the best Wii U games, and the recently released expanded port takes the platforming magic to new heights. Super Mario 3D World is a great blend of 3D Mario platforming and the classic Mario course structure. The sheer inventiveness on display across its 12 worlds (including four challenging bonus worlds) is enough to make this one of the better modern Mario games, and the fact you can play the entire campaign with up to four players makes it a great pick for families. Bowser's Fury brings something entirely different to the table with an open-world design with a series of mini levels that gradually unlock as you collect Cat Shines and square off against a very large and angry Bowser. Overall, the package includes a staggering amount of variety and demonstrates how Nintendo's trusty mascot still has tricks up his sleeve all these years later.\nRead ourSuper Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury review.\nSuper Mario Bros. Wonder is the first new 2D Mario in years not under the \"New Super Mario\" brand, and the reason why couldn't be clearer. While the New SMB series was well-made as a retro throwback, Super Mario Wonder is a true evolution of Mario mechanics that pushes the series forward in ways that we haven't seen for years. The marquee Wonder effects imbue every stage with wild, unique mechanics, while a new Badge equipment system lets you experiment with different powers. New stage types and power-ups abound as well, making this an absolute delight.\nRead ourSuper Mario Bros. Wonder review.\n\nSuper Mario Odyssey is a relentlessly joyful 3D platformer that gives players far more freedom than they've had in previous 3D Mario games. Super Mario Odyssey has a series of large, open levels, each of which is chock-full of Power Moons to find by completing tricky platforming sequences, besting foes, and solving puzzles. It also introduces a new array of moves thanks to Mario's sentient hat Cappy. If you're playing Super Mario Odyssey with young children, the cooperative mode is excellent, as it allows one player to take control of Cappy, who can't take damage. Super Mario Odyssey is Mario's biggest adventure yet, with more to see and do than ever before in a 3D Mario game.\nRead ourSuper Mario Odyssey review.\nWith more than 80 fighters so far, more than 100 stages, and a wide variety of content whether you're playing multiplayer or refining your skills against the CPU, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is the most comprehensive and plentiful brawler in franchise history. The expansive roster of characters with totally different playstyles is impressive enough to keep you playing for the long haul, but Smash Bros. Ultimate is far more than just a collection of Nintendo characters and anime characters with swords hitting each other repeatedly; it's a deeply satisfying brawler that refines the overall gameplay to make the most technically sound Smash Bros. to date. It's full of video game history, too, from unlockable trinkets to iconic music. Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is the best fighting game on Nintendo Switch. We'd also recommend the Fighter Passes, which grant access to additional characters and stages.\nRead ourSuper Smash Bros. Ultimate review.\nTetris and the Nintendo Switch are a perfect match, so it's no surprise that the best iteration of the classic puzzle game has found its way on this list. Tetris Effect: Connected has been around for a few years, delighting fans with its jaw-dropping mix of special effects, catchy music, and block-stacking, but it only just arrived on Switch in 2021. This is pure Tetris, but it adds heaps of style that creates an entrancing experience that's easy to get captivated by. Tetris Effect has a great single-player campaign mode as well as a slew of game variants in its Effects mode. The \"Connected\" portion of the experience lets three players join up to fight increasingly challenging CPU-controlled bosses. Whether you're primarily playing solo or dropping garbage blocks with friends, Tetris Effect: Connected is the best way to play Tetris.\nRead ourTetris Effect: Connected review.\nBetween Mario and Zelda, it's a shame that Xenoblade Chronicles doesn't get more love on Nintendo platforms. But for anyone looking to see superstar developer Monolith Soft at its very best, the trilogy of Xenoblade Chronicles games available right now are masterpieces of JRPG design, worldbuilding, and incredible visuals. Make no mistake, these games are incredibly deep and have steep learning curves, but stick with them and you'll find a rewarding experience waiting for you at the end.\nXenoblade Chronicles 3 is easily the best of the bunch, a lengthy and stunning adventure that can keep you occupied for the rest of 2023. A testament to just what the Switch is capable of when a developer is firing on all cylinders, each Xenoblade game is worth investing your precious time and delivers a unique magic that you'll only find on Nintendo hardware.\nRead ourXenoblade Chronicles 3 review.\nRemoved:Disco Elysium, Eastward, Golf Story, The House in Fata Morgana, New Pokemon Snap, Pepper Grinder, Ring Fit Adventure, Splatoon 2, Super Mario Maker 2, Unicorn Overlord",

The game follows Alan Wake as he seeks to escape from the Dark Place, while a concurrent campaign follows FBI agent Saga Anderson. The twisting (and very meta) story lets both characters inform and illuminate one another, delivering a visually striking and eerie experience full of moments like you've never seen in a game.\nRead ourAlan Wake 2 review.\nA rare example of a metroidvania that goes light on combat mechanics and heavy on puzzle-solving, Animal Well is a brain-scratching indie debut. The world is dense with secrets to uncover and tiny nooks to discover, as your little egg-like protagonist avoids confrontations with large animalistic predators. The game unfolds in surprising ways, as each layer becomes more intricate and engaging than the last. And the dark, low-fi aesthetic looks notably distinct while remaining perfectly readable for the tightly designed platforming. The PS5 is a great place to play because the haunting glow of Animal Well's world looks nice on a big screen.\nRead ourAnimal Well review.\n\nPlayStation mascot Astro had already debuted on PlayStation 5 with Astro's Playroom, a pre-installed tech demo that showed off the capabilities of the DualSense controller. In Astro Bot, the adorable little Sony mascot comes into its own with a full-fledged sequel that is also, as of now, the best-reviewed game of the year. Not only does Astro Bot squeeze technical wonder out of the PS5 capabilities, but it's also just a constantly surprising and impeccably well-crafted platformer that earns a place next to the very best the genre has to offer. It's a can't-miss on PS5, especially if you enjoyed the little taste from Astro's Playroom.\nSee ourAstro Bot review.\n\nLarian's masterpiece RPG is an incredible display of player agency and choice. The game replicates the Dungeons & Dragons experience like no other, giving you the freedom to approach scenarios in almost any way you can imagine, truly crafting your own tale as you engage with a multitude of memorable characters. It's mechanically complex but approachable, often beautiful to watch, and always gripping.\nRead ourBaldur's Gate 3 review.\nThe Call of Duty series has been among the top sellers for years, but some CoD games areclearly better than others. Black Ops 6 is a smart and varied action spectacle, and the best the series has been in some time. The 1990s paranoid thriller sets you on thrilling missions set against the backdrop of global events in the 1990s. On the multiplayer side, the new omni-movement makes matches feel fast and fluid, especially with the addition of inventive new maps that let you explore the space in a variety of ways. A revision to the perks system helps you specialize to fit your playstyle. Call of Duty has earned its reputation for a reason, and this latest release shows why.\nRead ourCall of Duty: Black Ops 6 campaign reviewandmultiplayer review.\n\nWhile Control was a great game when it launched in 2019, it had some issues with performance on PS4, especially on base models. With the power of the PS5, Control runs amazingly well. The particle physics really pop in 4K, and the performance is silky smooth. The Ultimate edition comes with both of Control’s expansions, which expand on a story that’s full of surprises and gripping performances. In Control, you play as Jesse Faden, the new director of the Federal Bureau of Control, a secretive agency that investigates supernatural events. Control’s combat is thrilling, with a great mix of standard third-person gunplay and abilities that ooze with style. The story is thought-provoking and, at times, mind-bending. It’s also elevated by a foreboding atmosphere and beautiful art style. If you missed out on Control the first time around, you can now play it in its ideal form on PS5.\nSee ourControl review.\nA retro-styled isometric horror game in the vein of classic Resident Evil, Crow Country manages to evoke the feeling of those tense games without relying too much on sheer imitation. The game mixes its nostalgic touches with modernized updates and techniques to make it appealing to modern audiences, and the world is full of smart puzzles and secrets to discover. It also boasts an engaging story with a memorable ending, which along with its moody setting and rich world, are more than enough to make up for its less-than-stellar combat.\nRead ourCrow Country review.\n\nDeathloop is set on Blackreef island, a strange place where the party never stops and everyone wants to kill our protagonist, Colt. The island is stuck in a time loop, and the only way to break it is by hunting down and killing a list of targets. Colt retains his memories from each loop but so do all of his targets. They know he's coming. Deathloop is an absolutely enthralling shooter that deftly weaves into systems into the loop in a coherent manner that gradually builds over time. It also tells a gripping tale and features some incredible acting. It earned a rare 10/10 in our review.\nSee ourDeathloop review.\nThere's a reason the long-running Destiny 2 is the standard-bearer for live-service games. With rock-solid shooting mechanics, tons of customization options in both gameplay and cosmetics, and years of post-launch content with more on the way, the game has attracted and retained a large and devoted audience of Guardians. Plus, Destiny 2 is free to download, allowing you to play a decent chunk of story content as well as competitive multiplayer without spending a dime. Destiny 2 also happens to look incredible in 4K on PS5.\nSee ourDestiny 2: The Final Shape review.\nA fast-paced action game with stylish combat is the perfect candidate for a PS5 upgrade. Enter Devil May Cry 5 Special edition, the definitive console version of Capcom’s 2019 action game. DMC 5 Special edition is impressive from a technical perspective and offers three different graphics and performance settings that offer different combinations of improvements such as ray-tracing, 4K resolution, or even gameplay at up to 120fps. It also comes with the Vergil DLC, which lets you play through the game as Dante’s twin brother. Two new modes are included as well: Turbo and Legendary Dark Knight. Turbo speeds the game up, while Legendary Dark Knight adds more enemies to the fight. Overall, the technical improvements and new content make DMC 5 Special Edition worth playing even if you already beat the original on PS4. It’s one of the best action games in recent years and includes one of the deepest combo systems ever in the genre.\nSee ourDevil May Cry 5 review.\nDiablo 4 was already a well-crafted dungeon-crawling RPG, but it got a whole lot bigger with the addition of its first major expansion, Vessel of Hatred. The expansion adds a lengthy new story chapter picking up right where the main campaign left off, detailing the creeping influence of Mephisto. While the expansion comes alongside a host of changes and improvements to the core game and leveling structure, many of them available to all players with or without the expansion, the major centerpiece of Vessel of Hatred is the new Spiritborn class. The powerful new melee class focuses on swift strikes that smoothly combo into each other, from a variety of disciplines that can be mixed-and-matched.\nSee ourDiablo 4 reviewandVessel of Hatred review.\nAfter more than a decade as a somewhat obscure cult hit, Dragon's Dogma finally received its long-awaited sequel. Dragon's Dogma 2 delivers on everything that made the first game so memorable and builds upon it with a grander scope and more complex atmosphere and pawn behaviors. On top of that it excels in moments of epic scale, including one of the best boss fights we've ever seen in an RPG. This all combines to make the world remarkably immersive, full of small moments that create a living world and chock full of anecdotes that you create yourself.\nRead ourDragon's Dogma 2 review.\nElden Ring was the runaway hit of 2022 and our Game of the Year. We've been patiently awaiting the promised Shadow of the Erdtree expansion, and this year From Soft delivered in a big way. The DLC provides a massive new area to explore, dense with secrets to uncover and new challenges to overcome. The smart balancing system lets you experience the feeling of progression even with your most overpowered build, and it deepens and expands upon the belovedElden Ring lorein rich, sometimes shocking ways.\nRead ourElden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree review.\n\nFinal Fantasy VII Remake earned a rare 10/10 from GameSpot for its exhilarating and strategic combat, charming characters, stunning depiction of Midgar, and the ways it stands on its own apart from the original. Its PS5 version, sold as Final Fantasy VII Remake: Intergrade, majorly upgrades the game's graphics and performance with next-gen power, offering two modes: one that lets you play the game in 4K with a lower frame rate, while the other prioritizes running the game in 60fps with sacrificing some graphical improvements. Notably, Intergrade also includes theIntermission DLC, which features a new story starring the lovable ninja Yuffie, adds new side missions and the Fort Condor minigame, and helps flesh out the wider FF7 universe. Whether you already own and played FF7 Remake on PS4 (in which caseyou can upgrade your game to the PS5 version for free) or are jumping in for the first time, Intergrade is the definitive version of a must-play adventure.\nSee ourFinal Fantasy VII Remake: Intergrade review.\nFinal Fantasy VII Remake impressed us with how it rethought the very structure of what a classic game remake could be. The second in the planned trilogy, Rebirth, expands its scope outside the steampunk city of Midgar and into a lush open world, giving you no shortage of activities and minigames to occupy your time as you pursue the deadly Sephiroth. While this middle chapter loses some of the focus of its predecessor, it makes up for it by further polishing the already tightly designed combat, introducing a wide cast of new and familiar faces, and deepening the mysteries at the heart of the remake trilogy. Plus, we just can't get enough Queen's Blood, the new card game that's so good it could stand on its own as a separate release.\nSee ourFinal Fantasy VII Rebirth review.\n\nGhost of Tsushima was the last major exclusive to release on PS4 and made the most of the hardware since it already looked incredible and ran extremely well. The free PS5 upgrade makes the details of Tsushima’s lush open world even more rich and expressive. If you missed out on Ghost of Tsushima at the end of the PS4’s lifecycle, the upgrade, which supports gameplay at 60fps and 4K resolution, makes it look and feel like a native PS5 game. You play as Jin Sakai, a samurai who barely staves off a violent death and sets off on an adventure to thwart the first Mongol invasion of Japan. Ghost of Tsushima has great, fluid combat and well-integrated stealth mechanics. The open-world quest structure does feel fairly familiar, but all of the other aspects make it worth the occasional repetition.\nOutside of the campaign, there’s a surprisingly awesome co-op multiplayer mode dubbed Legends that adds numerous new layers to an already-great game. You can also opt for the Director's Cut, which includes a brand-new story expansion that adds to the overall narrative.\nSee ourGhost of Tsushima review.\nGod of War is one of the most stunning PS4 games, and it is even prettier on PS5. The PS5 update adds a performance mode with 4K resolution that runs at 60fps. God of War is one of the best PlayStation exclusives in a long time already, so it’s definitely worth revisiting or playing for the first time on PS5 if you haven't yet. Its sequel, God of War Ragnarok, is a massive expansion of the concept and a continuation of the story. It's just as visually outstanding, while refining the already stellar combat and giving you new tools and RPG-like features to help you make the combat your own. It also continues, and possibly concludes, the apocalyptic story that the first game began, making these two a perfect duology to experience on your PS5.\nSee ourGod of War Ragnarok review.\n\nThough it doesn't have much competition, Gran Turismo 7 is the best racing game on PlayStation 5 so far. That's probably not much of surprise considering the franchise's pedigree, but it's wonderful to experience a return to form for the iconic Gran Turismo brand. As hard as it is to believe, it's been more than eight years since the release of Gran Turismo 6. GT 7 ushers the series into a new, stunning era thanks to the PS5's powerful hardware. Gran Turismo 7 has top-notch car handling, a wide variety of single-player content, and heaps of customization that will undoubtedly make car enthusiasts happy. With more than 30 tracks and 400 cars, Gran Turismo 7 has a lot to offer at launch. If you get one racing game on PS5, it should be Gran Turismo 7.\nSee ourGran Turismo 7 review.\nHades is a roguelike that could make you fall in love with the genre. In Hades, you play as Zagreus, the god of rebirth. Your goal is to escape from the underworld, but it won't be easy. Played from an isometric perspective, Hades has fast-paced and challenging combat that relies both on nimble fingers and strategic forethought. Between each run through the enemy-laden rooms, Hades compelling tale filled with interesting gods and goddesses unfolds. With plenty of room for experimentation and a structure that rewards you for sticking with it, Hades is an immensely satisfying action game.\nSee ourHades review.\nIO Interactive’s Hitman reboot trilogy has proven to be one of the most inventive and interesting stealth-action series ever made. Hitman 3 caps off the World of Assassination trilogy on an all-time high note for the franchise as a whole. The hallmark of the trilogy has been player choice in intricate sandbox-style levels, and that is readily on display in Hitman 3, giving players a dizzying number of ways to tackle objectives as Agent 47. Brilliant level design is complemented by lively characters who draw you into this mesmerizing and often absurd world. Hitman 3 also places a greater emphasis on its story, which trickles down to the atmosphere to create a campaign that feels more consequential. With the \"World of Assassination\" update, you can play through all three games of content along with the engaging roguelike Freelancer mode.\nSee ourHitman 3 review.\nHorizon Forbidden West is an excellent demonstration of the power of the PS5. Arguably the most beautiful open-world game ever made, Horizon Forbidden West is a visual triumph whether you're playing in performance or graphics modes. Aloy's second adventure takes place after the events of Zero Dawn, with the heroine on a new quest to unearth answers to the past in order to save the future of the world. Horizon Forbidden West has a nice mix of stealth and action-oriented combat when it comes to the signature machines (robot dinosaurs). If you're looking for a gorgeous open-world game with near endless activities, Horizon Forbidden West is bursting at the seams with content. The main quests are the stars of the show, but there are a bunch of compelling sidequests that encourage players to explore. While there might actually be too many systems in Forbidden West, those who like these sorts of open-world games will undoubtedly appreciate how much there is to see and do.\nSee ourHorizon Forbidden West review.\nThe second cooperative-only game from Hazelight--the studio behind A Way Out--It Takes Two is a much more successful effort because actually controlling the characters doesn't feel like an afterthought. It's a delightful and experimental platformer set in a fantastical world imagined by a girl during her parents' heartbreaking divorce, and both Mom and Dad are forced to work together as they rekindle their love--via puzzles and jumping challenges, of course. Frequently hilarious and with inventive ideas in nearly every area, It Takes Two is the work of a studio that truly understands its strengths and where its previous games could have been better, and despite director Josef Fares' outspoken, often vulgar statements making him more of a meme than a man, he is also a true creative force.\nSee ourIt Takes Two review.\nCapcom has had a string of wins with its established franchises, recently releasing a steady stream of well-received new games like Street Fighter 6 alongside remakes like Resident Evil 4. Kunitsu-Gami shows the publisher hasn't lost its step for new franchises, producing an inventive blend of demon-slaying action and tower defense strategy that each feel intense and satisfying in their own ways, and especially combined together. Inspired by Japanese folklore, you need to constantly balance purging the demons, rescuing villagers, and building traps. It's a lot to manage, but spinning these plates simultaneously creates a compelling gameplay loop that's hard to put down.\nRead ourKunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess review.\n\nFollowing the blockbuster success of the first Spider-Man game from Insomniac and its interstitial sequel Miles Morales, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 lets the two Spider-Men join forces in a sprawling and gorgeously rendered New York City. The two are come face to face with Kraven the Hunter, who has come to New York targeting Spidey's rogues gallery. The dual protagonists lets you play with two sets of powers, while the cinematic story is a treat for long-time web-heads.\nRead ourSpider-Man 2 review.\nPersona series director Katsura Hashino has returned with his first new game since 2016, and it's a fantastic one. Metaphor: ReFantazio is similar structurally to the Persona series, but it features a new original storyline set in a fantasy world, and a wide array of characters to find and classes to unlock. The turn-based RPG combat unfolds beautifully into deep layers of strategy, and the story is an affecting meditation on the power of storytelling. Metaphor: ReFantazio is one of thefew games in our history to earn a 10/10 review.\nRead ourMetaphor: ReFantazio review.\n\nNo game had a better comeback story last generation than No Man’s Sky, the ambitious space-exploration sim from Hello Games that originally launched to mixed reception in 2016. In the years since, Hello Games has changed the narrative from unfulfilled promises to exceeding expectations. From adding a bevy of new features like base-building and space fleet management to introducing entirely new ways to play thanks to multiplayer, No Man’s Sky has become a wonderful experience. On PS5, No Man’s Sky runs in 4K at 60fps, has more detailed planets, and features better lighting and shadows. For a game that focuses on exploration and discovery, No Man’s Sky’s visual and technical improvements make it an even worthier voyage across space.\nSee ourNo Man's Sky Next review.\n2024 opened with a pleasant surprise, as the classic and influential platforming series Prince of Persia returned as a metroidvania. The mysterious Mount Qaf is a perfect setting for an exploration-focused adventure, with biomes ranging from a royal library to a dank catacombs. Combat is tight and focused, with enough depth and nuance in its parry and counter system to provide a satisfying challenge, and flexible difficulty options to let players of almost any skill level feel appropriately tested.\nWhat stands out most about The Lost Crown, though, is its array of thoughtful metroidvania choices. Subtle visual cues and smart map options make it clear that this was a labor of love from fans of the genre, and the result is a new leader in the space. Expect to see other metroidvanias following the Prince's lead.\nRead ourPrince of Persia: The Lost Crown review.\n\nA PS5 exclusive, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is a thrilling adventure in the action-platforming series, and it looks and feels incredible on next-gen hardware. Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart introduces a lovable new character, Rivet, who teams up with the iconic duo after they're thrust into an alternate dimension. With gorgeous visuals, immersive DualSense functionality, and new traversal tools that refine platforming and combat, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart was one of the first games that felt truly \"next-gen\" and is a must-play for any PS5 owners.\nSee ourRatchet & Clank: Rift Apart review.\nResident Evil 4 is one of the most revered third-person action games of all time, and one that helped set the standard for years to come. Capcom's decision to remake the classic couldn't have come lightly, but the studio pulled off the feat with aplomb and met the understandably high expectations. The remake of Resident Evil 4 is not just a significant visual improvement over the original. It's a thoughtful reimagining of the best parts of RE4, and a reinvention of the pieces that were less successful. The result is a game that is both recognizable and fresh, paying homage to a fantastic game and making it feel utterly modern in the process.\nSee ourResident Evil 4 review.\nReturnal is not a game for everyone--it's extremely difficult and its roguelite structure can feel overwhelming at first--but those who keep playing will be rewarded with one of Housemarque's best games. Essentially a AAA-level third-person shooter with arcade sensibilities, it retains the essence of Housemarque's older, smaller games like Nex Machina and Resogun, with dodging through enemy projectiles and memorizing their attacks playing a huge role. But on top of this is a surprisingly deep story focused on an astronaut named Selene and a planet that she just can't seem to escape, even in death. Shortcuts and a little bit of luck can make the run between the game's six different biomes much less daunting, and little tidbits of exposition and world-building make even your failed runs feel worthwhile. And that's good, because you're likely going to have a lot of them before you see the ending.\nSee ourReturnal review.\nA remake of one of the most celebrated and influential survival horror games of all time, Silent Hill 2 had a daunting task, which Bloober Team handled with aplomb. The remake is a haunting thrill ride, featuring tense combat that has been reimagined for the new perspective, more wide-open atmospheres that don't compromise the original's atmosphere, and great creepy sound design that enhances the experience. By reverently keeping the things that worked best about the original while carefully updating certain aspects for modern audiences, this is a great way to experience Silent Hill 2 again, or for the first time.\nRead ourSilent Hill 2 review.\n\nAfter debuting on Nintendo Switch, Shin Megami Tensei V has come to other platforms as SMT V: Vengeance. This enhanced port addresses feedback from the original release with new features, like better navigation tools. But the real draw of any Shin Megami Tensei game is its story and characters, which have gotten a major update with loads of new story content to enhance your relationships with human and demons alike, including some real surprises for returning players.\nSee ourShin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance review.\n\nStreet Fighter 5 was a divisive part of the long-running fighting franchise, and clearly Capcom intended Street Fighter 6 to be a reset. It appears to be mission accomplished, as the latest game is getting praise across the board for being an excellent entry for fighting game veterans as well as a great entry point for those who have had trouble penetrating the scene. A newly refined combo system also helps novices learn not just how to pull off complicated moves, but also the strategy behind when and why to do it. Perhaps the wildest revision is a new World Tour mode, which has you create a custom fighter with their own blend of moves that you learn from several masters--famous Street Fighter characters like Ken and Chun-Li. And the fighters themselves are a diverse set of strange and inventive new characters alongside classic faces like Blanka and Dhalsim. It all comes together to be the best Street Fighter package in years.\nSee ourStreet Fighter 6 review.\nThe philosophical first-person puzzler The Talos Principle demanded a sequel as ambitious and heady as it was, and the second game delivers. Talos Principle 2 is once again a contemplative experience that raises big questions even as you stay occupied with a series of clever puzzles. You'll explore deep existential questions and unravel the nature of the world. The first game was an unexpected treat but The Talos Principle 2 shows that developer Croteam can still create a delightful puzzle box even when we think we know what to expect.\nRead ourThe Talos Principle 2 review.\n\nThe cult classic Space Marine has finally received a sequel more than a decade later, and it's just what fans have been waiting for. The new game retains its predecessor's brutal and bloody action, but with refinements that make it feel more fluid and tactile. It uses the Warhammer tabletop license to great effect with excellent world-building and an overwhelming sense of scale, but its crunchy combat should appeal to those who have never delved deep into the franchise as well.\nRead ourWarhammer 40,000 Space Marine 2 review.\n\nYakuza: Like a Dragon's PS5 version supports native 4K resolution or 60fps with a slight dip in resolution. Like a Dragon is the most experimental entry in the beloved Sega series. With a charming new protagonist, Ichiban Kasuga, and an inspired turn-based battle system, Yakuza: Like a Dragon takes the series in a whole new direction. Still, it retains all of the endearing quirks that Yakuza is known for, which makes Like a Dragon a great experience for longtime fans and newcomers alike. Along with its incredible mainline story, Like a Dragon has a ton of awesome side content that makes seeing and doing everything in its beautiful world a worthwhile endeavor. It's worth noting that while the PS4 version has a free upgrade to PS5, save data doesn't transfer.\nSee ourYakuza: Like a Dragon review.",

Alan Wake 2 is the sequel 13 years in the making, and it delivers. The story follows the author Alan Wake and FBI agent Saga Anderson through a mind-bending dual campaign. It leans more into horror than its predecessor and contains some truly unforgettable moments.\nRead ourAlan Wake 2 review.\nWhile it might be a stretch to call Alan Wake underrated, it definitely didn't receive the massive audience that it deserved when it originally launched in 2010. Hopefully Alan Wake Remastered (and the rousing success of its sequel) will change that. The action-adventure game stars a thriller novelist whose wife disappears while they are on vacation. Things really start to get weird when plot points from a novel he doesn't remember writing start happening in real life. The remaster gives the wonderful written game a fresh look and adds some new secrets to uncover. It's worth playing whether you experienced the original or not and the gameplay holds up remarkably well.\nRead ourAlan Wake Remastered review.\nThe Call of Duty series has been among the top sellers for years, but some CoD games areclearly better than others. This year's iteration, Black Ops 6, is the best the series has been in some time. The campaign is a smart and varied action spectacle that keeps you on your toes as it explores paranoid thriller tropes set against global events in the 1990s. Meanwhile, the multiplayer's new omni-movement makes matches feel fast and fluid, especially with the addition of inventive new maps that let you explore the space in a variety of ways. A revision to the perks system helps you specialize in interesting ways. Call of Duty has earned its reputation for a reason, and this latest release shows why. This is also the first year that the newest Call of Duty has been available on Game Pass at launch, so if you're a subscriber to Xbox's signature service you can hop right in.\nRead ourCall of Duty: Black Ops 6 campaign reviewandmultiplayer review.\n\nThis puzzler that uses its unassuming premise--following the life of a small insectoid creature--to tell a gripping story about life and self-evolution. The environmental puzzles revolve around carrying orbs to create some truly head-scratching scenarios, and it ultimately culminates in an experience that will engage your brain both for its puzzle mechanics and the sheer meaning of it all.\nRead ourCocoon review.\nWhen Control originally launched in 2019, it seemed to be too taxing for console hardware. The next-gen release of Control: Ultimate edition remedies these issues. On Xbox Series X, Control can run in 4K, and it retains a steady 60fps. Alternatively, you can enable a graphics mode (not available on Series S) that runs at 30fps with ray tracing. Either option looks great, especially when making use of Jesse's powers. Control is a narrative-focused action game revolving around a mysterious government agency that investigates supernatural activity. With excellent and varied gameplay that feeds into the well-written tale, Control is one of the best action games in recent memory.\nRead ourControl review.\nDead Space spent years as a revered but dormant franchise, and a symbol of the types of games EA put out in the late-aughts. This remake took what was great about the original and modernized it, not just in terms of visual style but with smart revisions. The result is a game that effectively introduces Dead Space's unique, body horror style of action to a new generation of gamers. Slicing limbs off of necromorphs has never been so gross--or felt so satisfying.\nRead ourDead Space review.\nThe long-running live-service multiplayer game Destiny 2 has been going strong since 2017, but this may be among the best times in its entire history to jump in. After multiple expansions, Bungie has reached The Final Shape--the promised closing chapter of the story that has been building since launch--so you can now see how the story concludes its first saga and prepares for more to come. And with tons of past expansions, raids, cooperative play, PvP, and the Crucible, you'll never run out of things to do and new power combos to test. Destiny 2 also runs in 4K at 60fps on Xbox Series X and load times are drastically quicker than past generations where Destiny launched, which is a big deal for a game that has a decent number of loading screens.\nRead ourDestiny 2: The Final Shape review.\nFrom Software's Elden Ring is a masterpiece in open-world game design. With an absolutely massive world teeming with secrets, scenic vistas, and an almost overwhelming amount of activities to complete, Elden Ring was the defining game of 2022. Now the long-anticipated Shadow of the Erdtree expansion has been released, and it is once again an arresting and incredible action experience with seemingly boundless freedom to explore its massive landscape. Both the lore and the suite of gameplay opportunities have been greatly expanded, giving players new story details to explore and weapons to master. The combat is once again a challenge that will test even the most-experienced Tarnish to hone their skills and explore The Lands Between.\nRead ourElden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree review.\nPlayground Games is, hands down, the most consistent studio within the Xbox family, and the UK-based developer has been doing it for a decade without getting the recognition it deserves. Forza Horizon 5 just happens to be the best game it's ever made, taking drivers to a gorgeous and environmentally diverse Mexico filled with races to complete, challenges to try out, and hundreds of cars to earn. What makes Forza Horizon 5 so wonderful is that it fully embraces the core pillar of every great open-world game: choice. Do succeed, you can essentially play the game however you want, whether that's taking part in cross-country marathons or just jumping all the danger signs you can find. There's no wrong way to play, unless it's doing something you don't find fun, in which case there are probably 15 things within a mile of your location that youwillfind fun.\nRead ourForza Horizon 5 review.\nObsidian has had a surprisingly quick output since being acquired by Microsoft, including dabbling in some unusual projects. Grounded isn't the most off the beaten track that the studio has ventured--for that, see Pentiment below--but it's also not exactly what we would have expected from the studio most famous for games like The Outer Worlds. This is a sandbox survival game that takes place entirely in a suburban backyard, a la Honey, I Shrunk The Kids. It spent some time in early access but has since launched as a full release, challenging players to build their miniature survival camp and take on massive spiders and other threats, all while unfurling a surprisingly rich narrative.\nRead ourGrounded review.\nUnlike many roguelikes, Hades uses its structure to its narrative advantage. This starts with the protagonist Zagreus, who happens to be the god of rebirth. Played from an isometric perspective, Hades' loop sees you running through procedurally generated rooms filled with increasingly challenging enemies. The fast-paced action gameplay is an absolute joy, and it has some serious legs thanks to a plethora of different builds, including wildly different weapon play styles and abilities. Much of the storytelling is sandwiched between runs when you converse with other Greek gods and prepare for your next attempt to escape the underworld. Combining brilliant combat with top-notch writing, Hades is a must-play game even if you typically don't care for roguelikes.\nHalo: The Master Chief Collection has been around since 2014, but Microsoft and 343 have slowly built it into a living monument to its most iconic franchise. Now not only does the MCC encompass the original three Halo games and a suite of multiplayer options that spans the entire series history, but also includes Halo 3 ODST, Halo 4, and the highly regarded Halo Reach. Altogether, it's an incredible homage to one of gaming's most storied franchises.\n\nAfter making its name on spooky games like Ghostwire: Tokyo and The Evil Within, Tango Gameworks surprised players with this bright and colorful rhythm-action game. Hi-Fi Rush stars Chai, a lovable loser who accidentally gets his MP3 player embedded in his chest during a cybernetic surgery, which also granted him a robotic limb. What follows is a character action game in the model of a Devil May Cry, but set to catchy tunes. The animated art style is particularly a standout, taking a cel-shaded look to a whole new level and blurring the line between cinematics and gameplay.\nRead ourHi-Fi Rush review.\nGiven the prowess of IO Interactive's first two entries in the World of Assaassination trilogy, it's not really a surprise that Hitman 3 was an exceedingly good conclusion to Agent 47's latest arc. That said, Hitman 3 expanded on the foundation of its predecessors in some surprising ways. The game has since rebranded as \"World of Assassination,\" encompassing the full trilogy with added features.\nNew spins on the loop, including a delightful murder mystery level, make Hitman: World of Assassination feel fresh and inventive, too. In addition to tremendous level design and choice-driven gameplay, Hitman 3 does a better job of focusing on its story and the many lively NPCs that inhabit the sandbox-style levels. This is Hitman at its finest, though you should definitely play the entirety of the World of Assassination trilogy. You can also import the levels from Hitman and Hitman 2 and play them in one place with enhancements. The latest addition, theroguelike mode Freelancer, makes an already excellent game even better.\nRead ourHitman 3 review.\nIndiana Jones has had video game adaptations before, but MachineGames' new game is the definitive take on the famous relic hunter. The story is rich and engaging and fits right in with some of Indy's other great adventures. The character and worldbuilding help create a new original story set against the backdrop of Dr. Jones' other classic adventures. And in fitting with the character's improvisational style, the gameplay is a tightly designed clockwork of action, stealth, and immersive-sim elements. It's also available on Game Pass, so subscribers can don their stylish fedoras for free.\nRead ourIndiana Jones and the Great Circle review.\nOne of the most creative platforming games over the last several years--and one that manages to do that while requiring cooperative play--It Takes Two improves on Hazelight's previous game, A Way Out, in virtually every way. The whimsical gameplay is combined with a surprisingly dark story involving a couple divorcing, all while their daughter aims to keep them together through the power of imagination. The many gameplay mechanics could have felt overwhelming, but they're polished to a bright sheen that makes discovering the next one a joy. And with a buddy pass system included, only one of the people playing needs to own the game.\nRead ourIt Takes Two review.\nOne of Capcom's newest games is also its newest franchise, a demon-slaying action game that blends tower-defense elements. You'll purge demons, rescue villagers, and build traps in a setting and story inspired by Japanese folklore. It's a combination of elements that can feel almost overwhelming, but learning how to manage the various demands at once, and how the systems feed into and enhance each other, makes a package that feels special.\nSee ourKunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess review.\nPersona series director Katsura Hashino has returned with his first new game since 2016, and it's a fantastic one. Metaphor: ReFantazio is similar structurally to the Persona series, but it features a new original storyline set in a fantasy world, and a wide array of characters to find and classes to unlock. The turn-based RPG combat unfolds beautifully into deep layers of strategy, and the story is an affecting meditation on the power of storytelling. Metaphor: ReFantazio is one of thefew games in our history to earn a 10/10 review.\nRead ourMetaphor: ReFantazio review.\n\nAlready one of the best fighting games in recent memory, Mortal Kombat 11 is even more impressive on the powerful Xbox Series X hardware. Featuring 4K resolution and new visual flourishes, the gruesome action on screen is rendered in a ridiculous amount of detail. The base game already had an ample amount of content, including multiple single-player modes and competitive multiplayer. The Ultimate edition tosses in the Aftermath story expansion and Kombat packs including 12 additional fighters. Mortal Kombat 11 is one of those rare fighting games that balances solo and multiplayer content well, and it's also the type of fighter that's appealing to both casual players and die-hard fans alike.\nRead ourMortal Kombat 11 review.\nNo Man's Sky, much like Sea of Thieves, has improved mightily since launch. Over the years, developer Hello Games has released steady and substantial updates that have brought the space exploration game closer to its original, ambitious vision. No Man's Sky now features far more tangible activities, including base-building and even racing vehicles across tracks in multiplayer. No Man's Sky's next-gen update allows the game to run in 4K at 60fps. The performance enhancements also extend to lighting and shadows, which makes each of the randomly generated planets look even more detailed and alive. No Man's Sky is on Xbox Game Pass, so subscribers should absolutely check it out to see if they enjoy its loop.\nRead ourNo Man's Sky Next review.\nOri and the Will of the Wisps is a gorgeous platformer from Moon Studios that truly benefits from the power of the Xbox Series X. The stirring sequel runs in 4K at 120fps and supports HDR. Since Ori and the Will of the Wisps is filled with evocative, colorful settings and fast-paced platforming sequences, the boost in performance makes the already stellar experience even better. Ori and the Will of the Wisps is more of an action-platformer than its predecessor and introduces a number of new moves to employ in combat against enemies both big and small. The sprawling map is deftly designed to force you to make full use of Ori's expanded arsenal, which creates a more dynamic and satisfying adventure. If you haven't played Ori and the Blind Forest, you should play that first to get the full emotional weight of the understated but profound tale. Both games are available in the Xbox Game Pass library.\nRead ourOri and the Will of the Wisps review.\nLike Grounded, Pentiment is another example of Obsidian exploring new ground, and this adventure game certainly isn't your typical big-budget blockbuster. You play as Andreas Maler, a 16th century illuminator who becomes caught up in the mystery of a murder at an Abby. The game unfolds over the course of decades as you see how layers of history are built on top of each other, building toward a stirring conclusion. It's unlike anything you've ever played before.\nRead ourPentiment review.\nThe Plucky Squire is a charming Zelda-like set inside--and outside--of a storybook. As the title character of a popular book series, you're ejected from your own story and find your way back in, then gaining the power to jump in and out at will. That begins a very meta quest to save your land and your story from the villainous Humgrump by grabbing items from the real world to use them in the book, or even manipulating the book itself to solve puzzles. It's an inventive idea, and jumping in and out of the book always feels like magic.\nRead ourThe Plucky Squire review.\n\nPrince of Persia is known for being a precise and influential platformer series, but this latest entry makes it feel right at home in the metroidvania genre. The new direction fits the series like a glove, allowing Ubisoft to combine exploring a wide and varied map with series-favorite elements like precise platforming and tough combat challenges.\nBreaking with tradition, you don't play as the prince himself, but rather a member of his royal guard dispatched to save him from a betrayal within your ranks. The story that follows takes a few narrative shortcuts and can feel muddy, but it hints at a well-realized world full of mystery and magic. Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is one of the best new metroidvania games in years, and will likely serve as a template for others to follow.\nRead ourPrince of Persia: The Lost Crown review.\nRemarkably, Psychonauts 2 is even better than its predecessor. After suffering multiple delays, Psychonauts 2 released over the summer to critical acclaim. The return to the psychic camp for kids was long overdue, and Double Fine made the most of this sequel. It retains the humor and charming storytelling of the original while refining the platforming gameplay and upping the psychedelic nature of the levels. From a gameplay perspective, Psychonauts 2 is a huge improvement over its predecessor, both when traversing the levels and fighting baddies in combat. Where Psychonauts 2 really shines, however, is in its portrayal of its characters. Revolving around empathy and growth, Psychonauts 2 has an impactful message. It's easily one of Double Fine's best games, and you can play it on Xbox Game Pass.\nRead ourPsychonauts 2 review.\nResident Evil 4 was already considered one of the greatest action horror games of all time, and as a result it had been ported to other platforms countless times since release. After successful remakes of the previous games, expectations were set high for an RE4 remake, and Capcom delivered. This isn't just the best Resident Evil 4 has ever looked, it's also a beautifully refined take on the modern classic. It revises just enough to modernize and smooth out any rough edges while remaining utterly recognizable, and then builds new challenges on top of that to test even the most experienced players. It's a true testament to the enduring quality of Resident Evil 4.\nRead ourResident Evil 4 review.\nSea of Thieves has come a long way since launching in 2018. Rare has turned Sea of Thieves from a somewhat shallow pirate adventure into a swashbuckling success thanks to steady updates that have drastically overhauled the experience. Most importantly, Sea of Thieves now has an abundance of content, ranging from story missions to skeleton fleet hunts and much more. With better systems and more tangible rewards at stake, the core Sea of Thieves experience is more satisfying. On the next-gen consoles, Sea of Thieves runs at a smooth 60fps in 4K on Series X and in 1080p on Series S. The reduced load times on both consoles really help limit interruptions during your voyage, too. Sea of Thieves is well-worth diving into on Xbox Series X, and it's available on Game Pass.\nRead ourSea of Thieves review.\nShin Megami Tensei V was originally released exclusively for Nintendo Switch in 2021, but its enhanced version expands to new platforms and adds a ton of new content for fans of deep narrative-focused RPGs to absorb. Vengeance adds new story details and enhancements to connect with both human and demon characters, better navigation tools for exploring the rich world, and even a number of surprises for returning players to discover.\nRead ourShin Megami Tensei V Vengeance review.\nThe Talos Principle 2 expands and builds upon everything that made the cult debut memorable. The first-person puzzle game has you slowly peel back the layers of the world as you learn more about the web of mysteries at its heart, while also raising fascinating philosophical questions. This is a game that uses the medium to explore heady topics, and it's unlike anything else.\nRead ourTalos Principle 2 review.\nTetris Effect: Connected is magical on Xbox Series X. With 4K resolution and up to 120 fps, the particle effects that are so integral to Tetris Effect's presentation are even more detailed and stunning. Beyond the enhancements, Tetris Effect: Connected is just a delightfully inventive take on the best puzzle game ever made. It turns Tetris into an all-encompassing visual and audio experience thanks to an explosion of colors seen both in and outside the grid and the reactive tunes that will have you nodding along to the beat. In addition to an already great stable of modes, the Connected edition comes with great cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes to play locally or online. It's a relaxing experience, and one that's perfect to play for short spurts over the course of months (or even years).\nRead ourTetris Effect Connected review.\nWarhammer 40,000 Space Marine came out more than a decade ago, and fans of the action spectacle have been thirsting for a sequel ever since. It's finally arrived, and it's just what the Primarch ordered. The sequel adds refinements to make the combat feel more fluid than ever, as you crunch your way through hordes of Orks. It also makes excellent use of the Warhammer 40K license, building a world with a huge sense of scale while remaining approachable for those who don't know a Purgator from a Justicar.\nSee ourWarhammer 40,000 Space Marine 2 review.\n\nThe follow-up to Void Bastards takes some of its predecessor's roguelike elements and completely rethinks and retools others. This time you're in a space-faring version of the Old West, assembling a posse of alien outlaws to take on one last score. You'll navigate a board game-like map to grab as many resources as you can, and then go into direct FPS combat with varied characters that have their own unique powers. Wild Bastards rewards you for thinking outside the box with how to use these powers, and you can get away with breaking the game so much you might just feel like an outlaw yourself.\nRead ourWild Bastards review.\n\nYakuza: Like a Dragon released as a launch title for Xbox Series X with better performance, including options for native 4K or a solid 60fps at a slightly lower resolution, and these visual enhancements make Like a Dragon's world more vibrant and detailed. Sega has never been afraid to take risks with the quirky and moving Yakuza franchise, and Like a Dragon takes the biggest risk in franchise history by moving away from beat-'em-up combat in favor of a turn-based RPG system. The change funnels in from the personality of the new protagonist Ichiban Kasuga. Ichiban's mind often wanders, and he sees himself as a hero ripped out of Dragon Quest. This, in turn, shifts enemies into silly beings that are fought using an old-school turn-based system. Ichiban's personality is infectious, and the party-based system leads to some of the best interpersonal moments in franchise history. Yakuza: Like a Dragon may play wildly differently than previous entries in the series, but it still has all of the heart and charm that have kept fans coming back for more.\nRead ourYakuza: Like a Dragon review.",

        "body": "GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\nWith 2025 officially upon us, it's a good time to catch up with some big AAA games you may have missed, or to dabble with smaller games to find a new personal favorite. Game Pass is a great resource for experimenting with a ton of different games, so to help you navigate the ever-shifting landscape, we've rounded up the very best Game Pass games available now. We'll continue to update this list as the Game Pass library rotates.\nTo be clear, there are plenty more excellent games on Xbox Game Pass than the ones we’ve listed below--the service is loaded with worthy games. These are just the games we think every Xbox owner should play, and we regularly review this list to make sure we stand by our choices and rotate in newer releases.\nMore Xbox best lists\nKeep in mind, though, that Xbox Game Pass comes in various tiers at different pricing levels. Xbox Game Pass Core offers a smaller selection of games along with the online play functionality that used to be Xbox Live Gold for $10 per month. Xbox Game Pass for just the Xbox library is $11 per month, while Xbox Game Pass for PC is $10 per month. The best value by far is Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, which includes both the Xbox and PC libraries, along with cloud gaming functionality to play the Game Pass selections on your mobile device.\nHere are the best games to sample on Game Pass right now. Microsoft surely has more Game Pass inclusions on the horizon throughout the rest of the year, so keep an eye here for more of our favorite picks.\nXbox Game Pass Ultimate 3-Month Code\n$34 (was $50)\nThe first Plague Tale was an unexpected hit from a relatively small developer punching above its weight. The sequel could have expanded its scope, but instead, Asobo Studio kept its narrative tightly focused on telling a human story set in an alternative French history. Though the rat-controlling mechanics have been expanded, the story is still concerned primarily with the family dynamics between Hugo and his protective older sister, Amicia. It's also a downright beautiful game, with lush environments that rival those from the biggest AAA studios.\nRead ourA Plague Tale: Requiem review.\n\nArcade Paradise is an inventive blend of management sim and retro-styled compilation. As the manager of a laundromat with some arcade machines buried in the back, you'll slowly build up your collection of arcade machines, transforming the business into a successful arcade. But you also get to play the arcade machines yourself, unlocking achievements and getting high scores that help the machines generate more money for your business. The result is a compelling gameplay loop that also has asurprisingly resonant storyat its core.\n\nThe Call of Duty series has been among the top sellers for years, but some CoD games areclearly better than others. This year's iteration, Black Ops 6, is the best the series has been in some time, and the first time that a new Call of Duty game has been available on Game Pass at launch. The campaign is a smart and varied action spectacle that keeps you on your toes as it explores paranoid thriller tropes set against global events in the 1990s. Meanwhile, the multiplayer's new omni-movement makes matches feel fast and fluid, especially with the addition of inventive new maps that let you explore the space in a variety of ways. A revision to the perks system helps you specialize in interesting ways. Call of Duty has earned its reputation for a reason, and this latest release shows why.\nRead ourCall of Duty: Black Ops 6 campaign reviewandmultiplayer review.\n\nA logic puzzle game wrapped in a mind-twisting mystery, The Case of the Golden Idol has you solving a series of British murders by carefully inspecting dossiers and the environment to find inconsistencies. The inventive puzzle mechanic has you filling in missing words to solve the riddles. Xbox Game Pass has the full base game, but if you're itching for even more mysteries to solve there are extra Golden Idol Mysteries you can purchase as DLC.\nLots of games revolve around learning about strange creatures, but more often than not you're either beating them up or capturing them to have them beat each other up. That's not the case with Creatures of Ava, a story-rich adventure game that takes your role as a scientist and protector seriously. As you explore the alien landscape you'll have to protect yourself from aggressive fauna, but you do it with a creative take on combat that makes it family-friendly and humane. The world is rich with diverse biomes to explore and creatures to discover, and it's an easy recommendation for parents to enjoy with their kids.\n\nAn impeccably crafted indie platformer, Celeste is known for its tough-but-fair difficulty and surprisingly emotionally engaging story. As you climb the mountain you'll come face to face with devilish platforming challenges that will test your skill, all while discovering a subtle story of self-discovery and overcoming depression. It has astellar 94 score on Metacritic, so don't sleep on this one. And don't worry if you aren't a platforming pro, as Celeste has a full suite of difficulty modifiers that let you experience the climb on your own terms.\nRead ourCeleste review.\n\nA puzzle game built around communication, Chants of Sennaar approximates the feeling of slowly learning a new language while immersed in a strange new culture. As you solve puzzles to unlock new parts of these fictitious languages, you start to recognize snippets of meaning in speech and writing, and it meticulously unlocks new avenues to learn even more and venture further. The whole experience is built around the mythical Tower of Babel, as you make your way through a massive structure with various peoples speaking different languages along the way.\n\nWhen Microsoft finalized its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, it seemed like only a matter of time before the studio's massive library started to come to Game Pass. We're still waiting on a lot of the catalog, but it started with a big one. The latest in the beloved dungeon-crawling RPG series Diablo, Diablo IV, lets you delve into the deep and macabre world of Sanctuary to protect it from Lillith, the demon mother. With deep and immersive character building and a regular cadence of seasonal content to let you further expand your characters with new abilities, Diablo IV is not to be missed.\nRead ourDiablo IV review.\n\nBigger, bolder, and more brutal than ever, Id Software unleashed hell on Earth with Doom Eternal, much to the delight of everyone who played this sequel. Pure action from start to finish and unrelenting when the armies of the damned were thrown at you, Doom Eternal is a metal journey through the apocalypse that takes no prisoners.\nRead ourDoom Eternal review.\n\n\nGet the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.\nBy signing up, you agree to the ourTerms of Useand acknowledge the data practices in ourPrivacy Policy.\nWe'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.\nA spiritual successor to the beloved PS1-era Suikoden series, Eiyuden Chronicles was the latest in a long line of game creators using crowd-funding to revive their most famous works. In this case, it was Suikoden creator Yoshitaka Murayama and the newly founded Rabbit & Bear Studios promising a new RPG with tons of characters to recruit and a high fantasy story of intrigue and warring kingdoms. The result is a real treat for Suikoden fans and RPG lovers more generally, with beautiful 2D artwork, a compelling story, and a neat base-building wrinkle. Sadly Murayamapassed away shortly before release, making this his swan song.\n\nBetween its amazing visuals, myriad gameplay options, and bevy of content, Forza Horizon 5 is a racing game that anyone can enjoy. From a technical standpoint, it’s remarkable what the team at Playground Games achieved--everything from the meticulously detailed vehicle models to the lush virtual recreations of Mexico’s landscapes are visually engrossing.. Better yet, the gameplay is some of the best in the racing genre. Unlike the simulation-heavy Forza Motorsport line, the Forza Horizon series lean towards arcade racing, emphasizing player freedom in vast open worlds. Forza Horizon 5 doubles down on the philosophy, letting players focus on the type of experience they want--be that tense races against other players, single-player challenges and story content, or just chilling out and cruising the open road.\nRead ourForza Horizon 5 review.\n\nForza Motorsport goes back to the series' roots as a simulation track racer, with stunning recreations of high performance vehicles. Car progression and upgrades are streamlined enough for fans to understand, but with the ability to get your hands dirty under the hood with precise fine-tuning. It's a graphical showpiece for the Xbox, making it a great game to try on Game Pass regardless of whether you're a gear-head.\nRead ourForza Motorsport review.\n\nGears Tactics cleverly applies the aesthetic and atmosphere of the franchise to a tactics game. Despite being a totally different genre, Gears Tactics still feels like a natural addition to the iconic franchise thanks to sound mechanics and great level design. Many of the notable Gears of War gameplay systems and quirks are adapted into the top-down tactical spin on the genre. With a meaningful progression system, deep but approachable tactical encounters, and a number of great boss battles, Gears Tactics is a can’t-miss experience for Gears aficionados and strategy game fans alike.\nRead ourGears Tacticsreview.\nGet the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.\nBy signing up, you agree to the ourTerms of Useand acknowledge the data practices in ourPrivacy Policy.\nWe'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.\nIf you’ve never played the Halo franchise before, Halo: The Master Chief Collection is the perfect place to start. The Master Chief Collection comes with six Halo games, including remastered versions of the first two original Xbox entries. Halo features some of the very best single-player campaigns in the genre as well as extremely solid online multiplayer, at least after years of fixes and improvements. Back when the collection was originally released, the online multiplayer was spotty to say the least, but it has come a long way. Halo: The Master Chief Collection offers the best way to play some of the most heralded first-person shooters ever created.\nRead ourHalo: The Master Chief Collection review.\n\nHi-Fi Rush is a bright, popcorn animated adventure from the studio that brought you… The Evil Within? As surprising as that is, what may be even more impressive is that this is an absolute gem of a rhythm-action game. The original IP follows Chai, a good-hearted doofus who signs up for free cybernetic surgery and ends up with a Zune grafted into his chest. He comes out of the other side with the power to defeat corporate ne'er-do-wells to the gyrating beat of the world. It's like Elite Beat Agents mashed together with Devil May Cry.\nRead ourHi-Fi Rush review.\n\nEnchanting and utterly engrossing, Hollow Knight is one of the best metroidvanias ever made. Team Cherry’s adventure stars a nameless knight armed with a nail who explores a labyrinthine world known as Hallownest. With a gorgeous art style and an incredible amount of variation in the environments, Hollow Knight’s expansive world is a constant joy to explore. Challenging combat rewards those with patience and perseverance. Hollow Knight truly stands out in a fairly crowded genre. If you haven’t waded through Hallownest yet, now’s a great time to slay some insect ahead of the sequel, Hollow Knight: Silksong.\nRead ourHollow Knight review.\n\nMachineGames' take on Indiana Jones is a masterful take on the famous relic hunter. The action is a tightly designed clockwork of action, stealth, and immersive-sim elements that capture Indy's famous improvisational style. The story is rich and engaging and belongs right on the shelf next to some of Indy's other great adventures. And the character and worldbuilding are all top-notch, which helps to sell Troy Baker's take on the famous character popularized by actor Harrison Ford. It's the complete package, and a great reason to subscribe to Game Pass.\nRead ourIndiana Jones and the Great Circle review.\nThough it's still in early access, Manor Lords has quickly gained a following as a deep and engrossing strategy game that encompasses several different types of strategy at once. You'll build a city with complex social and economic systems at play, as well as take part in huge tactical battles against rival lords. Building your civilization from almost nothing and helping it manage trials like an unforgiving winter is so satisfying, and the depth of the game is made even more impressive by it beingthe work of just one developer.\n\nBaseball is an annual spring tradition, and recently, so is MLB The Show on Game Pass. The sports franchise game from Sony's San Diego Studio hits Game Pass on release day every year, letting you feel the crack of the bat right as the baseball season starts. This year's iteration, MLB The Show 24, brings back its Storylines mode with a new set of documentary-style tales regarding the Negro Leagues, and for the first time, Road to the Show features women as playable characters. Though parts are in need of a refresh at this point, the total package is still a satisfying way to play America's pastime.\nRead ourMLB The Show 24 review.\n\nMonster Hunter World introduced loads of new fans to the Monster Hunter series, which up to that point had a niche but enthusiastic audience in the West. That game spent some time on Game Pass, but it's since been removed and you can play the more recent Monster Hunter iteration instead. Rise borrows several quality-of-life improvements that made World such a success, and adds another one: the Wirebug, a new tool that lets you easily and quickly traverse the map by swinging through the wilderness. Monster Hunter Rise is an ideal entry point for franchise newcomers.\nRead ourMonster Hunter Rise review.\n\nA fast-paced first-person platformer, Neon White is a fresh take on competitive speedrunning. You'll have to master tight vertically-designed stages within a stylish afterlife setting, taking down enemies with panache along the way. The breakneck pace is unlike anything else, and it's easy to get lost for a long time promising yourself just one more run.\nOctopath Traveler was a daring new RPG concept from Square Enix in which the story was told non-sequentially, as you could play as any of eight protagonists in any order, experiencing their own unique stories. Octopath Traveler 2 improves upon its predecessor in every way, taking to heart critiques from the first game and making a standout RPG experience. The new cast of eight characters are well differentiated with skills both inside and outside of combat, and their distinct abilities create interesting puzzle scenarios for completing missions and side quests. The combat system is rich with possibilities, letting you leverage their strengths in satisfying ways. And the story ties the eight hero narratives together into a cohesive whole. If the first game was an experiment, this one is the proof of concept.\n\nBoth games in Moon Studios’ incredible Ori series are worth playing. Ori and the Blind Forest and its 2020 sequel Ori and the Will of the Wisps are two of the best platformers available on Xbox. Both have stunning visuals and tell emotionally gripping stories that feed off of the atmosphere and well-drawn characters. While they are similar in terms of aesthetic and feel, Ori and the Will of the Wisps is more action-oriented, whereas the Blind Forest largely focuses on platforming and exploration. The Will of the Wisps gives Ori new abilities that help them square off against daunting bosses. Both games are brilliant in their own right, and are must-play platformers on Xbox. You should play them in order to get the full emotional weight of the story.\nRead ourOri and Will of the Wispsreview.\nGet the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.\nBy signing up, you agree to the ourTerms of Useand acknowledge the data practices in ourPrivacy Policy.\nWe'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.\nOne of the most unusual games on Game Pass, or anywhere, Pentiment is an adventure game set in 16th century Bavaria. As a manuscript illustrator sent to an Abbey, you're caught up in a series of murders. The decades-spanning story explores the idea of historical narrative and how truth is recorded and remembered across generations. It's really unlike anything else.\nRead ourPentiment review.\n\nPersona 3 was the game to really set the mold for where the series would go, essentially splitting the game in half. It's part dungeon-crawling, turn-based RPG and part social sim where you manage the life of a high-schooler who teams up with other kids to secretly combat monsters at night. Reload improves on the original version of the game in numerous ways, introducing quality-of-life features and improved visuals that make this the best-playing version of Persona 3 (even if it does lack some portions of content from prior versions). This is a substantial experience that will keep you hooked over its dozens of hours, with a great story, terrific music, incredibly slick-looking menus, and fun combat.\nSee ourPersona 3 Reload review.\nThe first Pillars of Eternity was a thrilling study in old school RPG gameplay with a modern makeover, but its sequel outdoes the original in almost every way possible. A more confident follow-up that doubles down on its strengths while further refining its formula, Obsidian Entertainment's sophomore effort is an entertaining game filled with rich writing and easily-accessible gameplay for newcomers to the genre.\nRead ourPillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire review.\n\nIt's safe to say that there's no game like Psychonauts 2 on the market, as Double Fine's return to the cult-classic world of Razputin Aquato and the titular psychic peacekeeping agency is an absolute mind-blast of imaginative design. Fun to play and packing an emotional wallop with its exploration of several characters and a deep dive into their respective psyches, Psychonauts 2 is both a hilarious and heartfelt effort.\nRead ourPsychonauts 2 review.\n\nA live-service game that's not all about the shooting, Sea of Thieves is Rare's quirky take on a pirate simulator. It's gone through a lot of iterations since it was first released in 2018, so nowadays it's a full-fledged pirate simulator. You can crew your ship and sail the high seas, plunder other ships, find hidden treasure, and even deal with otherworldly pirate ghosts.\nRead ourSea of Thieves review.\n\nSlay the Spire marries deck-building with roguelike systems to create one of the best indies in recent years. Throughout your journey up the Spire, you square off against monsters, uncover treasures, and expand your deck of cards. Slay the Spire's card-based combat is easy to get the hang of but requires trial and error to find success. While you have to start back at the beginning each time you die, you gradually earn new cards, which help you advance further the next time. It’s an intoxicating loop that makes it easy to want to try “one more time” before putting down the controller. Each of Slay the Spire’s four playable characters have unique decks, adding a ton of incentive to brave the Spire for subsequent runs after the credits roll.\nRead ourSlay the Spire review.\n\nTunic, the long-awaited adventure starring a fox with a sword, is more than just a great Zelda-like. While it harks back to old-school Zelda games in terms of not guiding players toward the objectives, Tunic has its own approach to creating mystery and intrigue. All throughout the world you'll find pages of an instruction manual--really does look like one that would've been packaged with a game in the early '90s--that you have to piece together to learn about the world around you. It does a wonderful job replicating the thrill of discovery found in early Zelda games. Tunic is much harder than Zelda games from a combat perspective, but overcoming each challenge feels like a great triumph. Plus, any combat pains you may have are made worthwhile by gorgeous world that is a joy to explore.\nRead ourTunic review.\n\nAfter years of busting heads with the Dragon of Dojima, Yakuza: Like a Dragon came along to chart a new course for the long-running Sega franchise. Replacing Kiryu Kazama was the newly-paroled Ichiban Kasuga, a thug with a heart of gold who soon found himself caught in the middle of a vast conspiracy in the Japanese underworld. One other big change that Yakuza: Like a Dragon made was to its combat, as the game pulled heavily from classic Dragon Quest adventures to create a fresh spin on the RPG genre.\nRead ourYakuza: Like a Dragon review.\n",

        "body": "GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\nThese are our selections for the very best PC games. Without a generational divide, the PC gaming library just keeps growing, so we focused on the best PC games to play right now. Some of these games, like Balatro and Space Marine 2, are recently released gems. Others are live-service games or multiplayer favorites that have stood the test of time, like Destiny 2. Our list of the best PC games spans across a wide variety of genres, so at least a few of these games will pique your interest. We regularly reevaluate and update this list to make sure our recommendations are current, and you can find previously removed games--which still come highly recommended--at the bottom of the list.\nPC gaming is quite different from consoles, as your mileage with each game on this list will vary based on your rig. That said, many of the games on this list don't require the latest and greatest graphic cards--they merely help these great games look even better. And if you happen to have a Steam Deck, a lot of these games are playable on Valve's impressive handheld PC. We have a separate list ofSteam Deck recommendationsfor games that play great there. We regularly reevaluate and update this list, so you can always use it as a resource to find some fresh recommendations.\nWe've linked to Steam listings where possible for these games, but it's worth noting that you can often find better deals on storefronts such as Fanatical and GOG. We've included links to those stores, too. Also, some of our picks are available on PC Game Pass, Microsoft's subscription service.\nIf you're thinking about upgrading your PC or starting a new build to play some of these games at higher settings, make sure to check out ourstep-by-step guide for building a gaming PC. We also have a dedicated list focused on thebest Steam Deck gamesto play right now. If you're looking for accessories for your rig, check out our roundups of thebest gaming keyboards,gaming mice, andPC gaming headsets.\nAnother chapter in the mind-bending Remedy universe, Alan Wake 2 picks up right where the cult classic left off more than a decade ago. Alan is trapped in the Dark Place and his only way out is to write his own story. His campaign takes place alongside a concurrent one with FBI agent Saga Anderson, and the two complimentary campaigns can be played together in any order. The lightly spooky elements of the first game turn much darker here, for a horror experience full of unforgettable moments.\nRead ourAlan Wake 2 review.\n\nA deceptively simple concept with an incredible degree of replay value, Balatro is based around the familiar rules of poker. You'll build a hand of pairs or a flush and then accrue points based on it. But using that simple framework as a jumping pad, the roguelite card game lets you edit the rules of the game on the fly using special Joker cards, Arcane spells, and Planet cards that boost your multipliers. Building out a strategy as you work your way through increasingly difficult \"blinds\" with higher points requirements is satisfying for how it lets you feel like you're breaking the game in half, only to have the game come back at you that much harder the next time. When that inevitably happens, you need to think on your toes and modify your deck throughout the run to deal with new challenges. Jokers that may have seemed useless before can result in a sudden ah-ha moment of recognition as you take advantage of their unique strategies. And every time you make it to the end--or more likely, fail--it's hard not to start up another hand and do it all again.\nRead ourBalatro review.\nThe triumphant return of a legacy CRPG series is also one of the best games of 2023. While Baldur's Gate 3 is also available to play on PS5, the PC version is the clear leader thanks to its intuitive keyboard-and-mouse controls--and it's a welcome return to form for longtime Baldur's Gate fans. This fantasy tale is set in the Dungeons & Dragons universe, but the most incredible part is how it approximates actually playing a game of D&D, with all the freedom that entails. You can tackle problems and navigate the world with an almost overwhelming amount of choice and agency, making it easy to get lost for hours and then start all over again with a new character.\nRead ourBaldur's Gate 3 review.\nOne of the most original games of recent memory, Before Your Eyes has a simple premise that hinges on your ocular organs controlling the entire experience through a webcam. It's a short jaunt of a game that chronicles the life of a recently deceased person that you play as, but the catch here is that every time you blink, time moves forward. It's a terrific idea, incredibly well-implemented, and ties in perfectly with themes of memories, life, and storing those precious moments within ourselves. Unusual but packing a heavyweight emotional punch, you won't want to take your eyes off of this game for a single instant.\nSee ourBefore Your Eyes review.\n\nSome Call of Duty games areclearly better than others, and this year's iteration, Black Ops 6, is the best the series has been in some time. The campaign is a smart and varied action spectacle that keeps you on your toes as it explores paranoid thriller tropes set against global events in the 1990s. Meanwhile, the multiplayer's new omni-movement makes matches feel fast and fluid. A load of inventive new maps that let you explore the space in a variety of ways, and revisions to the perks system helps you specialize to fit your preferred playstyle. Call of Duty has earned its reputation for a reason, and this latest release shows why.\nRead ourCall of Duty: Black Ops 6 campaign reviewandmultiplayer review.\n\nThe Case of the Golden Idol is a throwback to classic point-and-click adventure games and an exacting puzzle game. You investigate scenes and then piece together what happened in a linear story narrative by placing names and verbs in their proper places. And if the original release whets your appetite for more, developer Color Gray games has spun off additional \"Golden Idol Mysteries\" DLC--new stories and mysteries with the same narrative-building mechanic.\nChildren of the Sun is a dark, atmospheric puzzle game centered around a sniper with a single bullet. As you seek revenge on the cult who destroyed your life and attempt to track down their mysterious leader, you skulk around their compounds searching for an angle before taking your shot. The puzzle aspect comes from what happens next, as each shot that connects to a cultist or explosive object lets you choose its next path. Trial and error to find the right path gets increasingly complex as the game adds new magic bullet effects like the ability to slightly arc a shot as it travels, or even reverse direction in mid-air. Though the campaign is on the short side, it's very satisfying to meticulously plan your route through a stage, making a puzzle-shooter experience unlike any other.\nRead ourChildren of the Sun review.\nCyberpunk 2077 had a divisive launch that by all accounts failed to live up to the lofty expectations placed on it. But CD Projekt Red didn't abandon the game, instead issuing a steady stream of updates culminating in September 2023's massive 2.0 update that overhauls many major systems, while also integrating the new Phantom Liberty DLC. The Cyberpunk of today is a sharper, more focused action-RPG with a greater variety of skills that let you navigate Night City your own way. The Phantom Liberty expansionreceived a 10/10 in our review, adding new systems and a compelling new story featuring Idris Elba. Best of all, it's still a gorgeous showpiece for your PC rig.\nRead ourCyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty review.\nDestiny 2 has been going strong for years, but with the release of The Final Shape, the first major story arc has reached its conclusion. That makes now the best time to play, since you can see the full story through with the closing chapter of this first saga. Even putting aside the narrative hooks, though, the game has constantly improving and polishing its modes to make a spectacular variety of things to do. You can explore the story, play cooperatively with friends, take parts in raids, compete in the Crucible, and more. The classes are well differentiated and offer plenty of opportunities to experiment and find your perfect build, and Bungie takes care to tweak and balance its weapons to make sure any of style of gunplay has a home. If you haven't checked out Destiny 2 in a while, now is a good time to give it another shot.\nRead ourDestiny 2: The Final Shapereview.\nDiablo 4 was already a well-crafted dungeon-crawling RPG, but it got a whole lot bigger with the addition of its first major expansion, Vessel of Hatred. The expansion adds a lengthy new story chapter picking up right where the main campaign left off, detailing the creeping influence of Mephisto. While the expansion comes alongside a host of changes and improvements to the core game and leveling structure, many of them available to all players with or without the expansion, the major centerpiece of Vessel of Hatred is the new Spiritborn class. The powerful new melee class focuses on swift strikes that smoothly combo into each other, from a variety of disciplines that can be mixed-and-matched.\nRead ourDiablo IV: Vessel of Hatred review.\nWhen it comes to writing,Disco Elysiumis perhaps unrivaled. Developed and published by ZA/UM in 2019, Disco Elysium places you in the role of a detective suffering from amnesia and a serious bout of alcoholism. His quest to unravel a baffling murder and the details of his life that he's forgotten takes you on an absolutely stunning adventure that thrives on its choice-based gameplay and exquisite dialogue. Disco Elysium balances humor and serious life dilemmas with astounding grace, and the freedom it gives you to shape the narrative and your interactions with its many colorful characters you meet allows you to make this detective story your own. Its gorgeous world is teeming with life, and viewing it from the eyes of a nameless cop with memory issues makes it all the more immersive. It earned a rare 10/10 from GameSpot, and we can safely say there's nothing else exactly like it in modern PC gaming.\nSee ourDisco Elysium review.\nElden Ring was our Game of the Year in 2022, and ever since we've been waiting to explore even more of The Lands Between. From Software delivered with Shadow of the Erdtree, a massive expansion that almost overwhelms with its sheer scope.Elden Ring's lorehas been expanded in thoughtful and surprising ways, letting you dive as deep into the story as you care to by exploring a world rife with secrets to uncover. Combat is just as difficult as ever, with an inventive balance system that lets you continue to play with your current character without being immediately overpowered. That lets you experience the thrill of overcoming new obstacles all over again, with a wide array of new weapons to master.\nSee ourElden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree review.\nIt's true that since its release in 2012,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrimhas been ported to just about every platform that can play games, including Amazon Alexa speakers and smart refrigerators. But the king of all Skyrim versions is the one on PC, and it's not even close. That's because the PC version gives you access to years of mods created by the Skyrim community. From adding serious RPG story content to providing ridiculous possibilities like replacing all dragons with Thomas the Tank Engine, the PC version of Skyrim adds nearly endless options to an already expansive, enormous game. You absolutely should play Skyrim on PC if you haven't, and you absolutely should mod it to see how the game has become so much more than it was when it was released. Skyrim is also available withXbox Game Pass for PC.\nSee ourThe Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim review.\nThe Final Fantasy series is known for having a strong focus on storytelling with colorful characters who get into over-the-top battles, and the MMOFinal Fantasy XIVmanages to stay true to what the series is all about. Though you might assume the familiar Final Fantasy tenets of storytelling and strong character moments would be absent in an online game, FFXIV is one of the more story-driven MMOs out today. Final Fantasy XIV is the franchise's second crack at an MMO, and it features a sprawling story about rebellion, equality, and friendship that manages to hit the same highs of the franchise's best single-player games. Though MMOs have a reputation for being inaccessible and time-consuming, Final Fantasy XIV offers an excellent gateway for lapsed and new MMO players to jump into--and it's also a fantastic Final Fantasy game in its own right.\nSee ourFinal Fantasy 14 reviewsfor A Realm Reborn and its expansions.\nHades 2 is still in early access, and only available on PC so far. But out of the gate it's already a fantastic experience. Hades 2 builds on everything that Supergiant established in the first game, offering an experience that is both familiar and new at once. You play as Melinoe, sister of former protagonist Zagreus, as you attempt to destroy Chronos, the Titan of time. New weapons and abilities, combined with a new resource management system, make it a joy to experiment with new combinations as you attempt your runs over and over. The experience feels very close to complete already, but if you'd prefer, the original Hades is still available, usually inexpensive, and just as good as ever.\nSee ourHades 2 review.\nThis follow-up from Arrowhead Game Studios was a surprising success, not least because it was so different from the original game that inspired it. Helldivers 2 takes the hordes of enemies from the top-down first game and makes it a third-person shooter, and the new perspective works beautifully. Squadding up with your friends leads to tense survival moments and hilarious mishaps in equal measure as you fulfill objectives and call down Stratagems on your foes. And like the first game, there's a galaxy-sprawling meta-game at play, as you and every other Helldiver fights to free territory controlled by vicious bugs and robots. This was also a rare Sony Interactive game published simultaneously on PC alongside its PS5 release, with optional cross-play, which likely helped it find and sustain an active player base.\nRead ourHelldivers 2 review.\nIO Interactive's grand World of Assassination trilogy reached its final chapter in 2021, as Hitman 3 built on the efforts made by its predecessors to create a perfectly executed experience. Bigger, bolder, and more cunning than ever, Agent 47's journey around the world saw him explore an opulent Dubai skyscraper, solve a murder mystery in an ancient British mansion, and turn a train into a slaughterhouse as he worked his way through each cabin. Each destination offers not only some devilishly delicious ways to eliminate targets, but also plenty of room for experimentation that leads to hilarious and grim demises for anyone who gets in your way.\nSee ourHitman 3 review.\n\nAt first glance, Inscryption looks like a mixture of tabletop card games with a healthy dose of deckbuilding thrown in for good measure as you risk your very life in a high-stakes game of survival. Throw in some roguelite progression, mystery, and a creepy art direction, and you've got the perfect mix for a game that hides more mesmerizing content beneath its surface. Absolutely strange while it deals out its ideas, that weirdness makes Inscryption the type of game that'll stay in your head long after you've played your last card.\nRead ourInscryption review.\nLorelei and the Laser Eyes defies easy categorization. While it is clearly a puzzle game, it frequently twists the medium on its head. It encourages you to use a notebook in real life to help track its many secrets and interlocking pieces, which all unfold into a marriage of design and narrative that need to be seen firsthand. The puzzles can be challenging, but they're consistently satisfying and help drive you forward to the next one. This is a can't miss.\nRead ourLorelei and the Laser Eyes review.\nPersona series director Katsura Hashino has returned with his first new game since 2016, and it's a fantastic one. Metaphor: ReFantazio features a new original storyline set in a fantasy world, and a wide array of characters to find and classes to unlock. The turn-based RPG combat unfolds beautifully into deep layers of strategy, and the story is an affecting meditation on the power of storytelling. It will seem familiar to fans of the Persona series, but the new setting and mechanical wrinkles make it feel very new as well. Metaphor: ReFantazio is one of thefew games in our history to earn a 10/10 review.\nRead ourMetaphor: ReFantazio review.\nIf soaring through the air and flying around the world is a dream of yours, there's no better game thanMicrosoft Flight Simulator. You can fly out of almost any airport in the world, including smaller airports in quieter towns, and go literally anywhere on Earth--though landing may be difficult in places like the Grand Canyon and Mount Everest. Microsoft used satellite imagery to recreate the world in-game, and it's improving both the game and map all the time. If there was ever a reason to invest in aflight stick or yoke system, it's Microsoft Flight Simulator. The game is available viaXbox Game Pass for PC.\nSee ourMicrosoft Flight Simulator review.\nAfter Monster Hunter World set a new benchmark for what the Capcom series was capable of, Monster Hunter: Rise had some big dragon leather boots to fill. Monster Hunter Rise is a showcase of what happens when you take the lessons learned from something new and apply it to an older example of Monster Hunter greatness, as the newest game in the series expertly shifted back to all-out action. Originally designed for the Nintendo Switch, Rise's port to PC came with a ton of free post-launch content, graphical upgrades, and performance enhancements that make this version the definitive edition of an already fantastic game.\nSee ourMonster Hunter Rise review.\nOn the list of great PC games, Pacific Drive is both fairly new and quite weird, which is funny since it's also firmly planted in the New Weird genre alongside stuff like Welcome To Night Vale, The SCP Foundation, and Remedy's Control. Built as a rougelite at heart, Pacific Drive has you going on numerous runs through the Olympic Exclusion Zone, a sectioned-off mass of forest roads in the Pacific Northwest, all while you dodge head-scratching (and often spooky) supernatural elements like crash test dummies that move when you aren't looking at them and buzzsaws that skim the roads like the shark skims the waters in Jaws. Its super-deep systems, intoxicating atmosphere, and incredible audio design combine to create a one-of-a-kind survival game.\nRead ourPacific Drive review.\nCapcom's venerable Resident Evil series has been progressively producing remakes of its classic library, but none of them held the expectations and weight of Resident Evil 4. It's long been regarded as one of the best survival-horror games of all time, and a trendsetter for the action-focused style of the genre. Capcom approached this remake especially cautiously, giving it a light touch of upgrades that make the whole experience feel modern without losing its soul. It's also never looked more beautiful, so you can see the horrific monstrosities of Las Plagas with newfound fidelity.\nRead ourResident Evil 4 review.\nThe Case of the Golden Idol was an ingenious deductive puzzler that challenged players to carefully examine scenes of grisly incidents and piece together the details of what occurred. It was a meticulous series of visual riddles, which led to a series of Golden Idol Mysteries as DLC spin-offs. Rise of the Golden Idol brings another array of brain-boggling mysteries to uncover, this time set against the backdrop of the 1970s. The setting is semi-modernized compared to the antiquity of the first game, but nothing has been lost in the translation. The mysteries are just as tricky as ever, letting you pore over the evidence until the answer suddenly clicks.\nRead ourRise of the Golden Idol review.\n\nShin Megami Tensei fans have needed a Nintendo Switch to play SMTV, until very recently. Shin Megami Tensei V Vengeance is now available on other platforms including PC, but this is much more than a simple port. The enhanced version adds loads of new content, like additional story details and new narrative surprises to let you get the most out of your relationships with human and demons alike. It also includes better navigation tools to address one flaw of its original version. This is the definitive version of what was already a deep and engrossing narrative RPG.\nRead ourShin Megami Tensei V Vengeance review.\nThe remake of Silent Hill 2 from Bloober Team is a haunting thrill ride, featuring tense combat that has been reimagined for the new perspective, more wide-open atmospheres that don't compromise the original's atmosphere, and great creepy sound design that enhances the experience. By reverently keeping the things that worked best about the original while carefully updating certain aspects for modern audiences, this is a great way to experience Silent Hill 2 again, or for the first time.\nRead ourSilent Hill 2 review.\nOnly The Stanley Parable, a nearly unexplainable game where things get regularly weird and meta, could get away with hiding what amounts to a sequel within the frame of an expanded re-release of the original game. Like the original title, the strange and hilariously distracted nature of The Stanley Parable is something that you have to experience for yourself, as words simply do not do it justice. With the Ultra Deluxe edition, you're getting an experience that feels like a game within a game, adding the illusion of freedom and other surprises along the way. It's nothing short of a clever and thought-provoking examination of video games and the relationship that we have with them.\nSee ourThe Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe review.\n\nIt starts with an old broken-down farm and a handful of seeds. You clear out the weeds and rocks until you get tired, and then you do it again. You get into the rhythm of daily life--visiting friends, watering crops, occasional light spelunking. Before you know it, it's been 75 hours and you're mostly managing your complex irrigation system and planning for next season's harvest.Stardew Valleyis a friendly, relaxing experience that also somehow manages to be endlessly addicting. Fans know the feeling of assuring themselves they'll play justonemore day before bed. And while it's appeared on just about every platform, PC often gets the first chance to test all of the little quality-of-life tweaks and new features that come with patches. Most recently, the massive Stardew Valley 1.6 update put a nice bookend on the game while developer ConcernedApe prepares for the next project, The Haunted Chocolatier.\nSee ourStardew Valley review.\nThe SteamWorld franchise doesn't iterate with sequels often, but when it does, you can count on it being worthwhile. SteamWorld Heist 2 takes the foundation built by its turn-based ricochet strategy game predecessor and builds and expands on it in every way. The missions and the world are bigger, and there's tons more to do. A new class system lets you mix and match powerful abilities into a mind-boggling array of possibilities, and a smart overleveling system helps stave off the pain of grinding. Not only that but you can outfit your characters, upgrade your ship, earn special unique skills for each character, and more. There's so much to explore in SteamWorld Heist 2 that it makes the dozens of hours go down smooth.\nRead ourSteamWorld Heist 2 review.\nThe third in a series of underappreciated horror game gems is another haunting entry perfect for fans of the genre. As the ghost hunter Juliette, you explore a surreal and shifting alien-like landscape that adds an otherworldly spookiness to the prior two games' more grounded horror. It largely retains and refines the mechanics of those earlier games, while also including their panache for incredible sound design that enhances the frights. Be sure to play with your headphones on, and the lights off. And if you need even more horror recommendations, especially for spooky season, check out ourfavorite horror games.\nRead ourSylvio: Black Waters review.\nThe follow-up to the philosophical first-person puzzle game is once again a contemplative experience that raises big questions even as you stay occupied with a series of clever puzzles. The philosophical underpinnings create a sense of expansive mystery as you explore deep existential questions and unravel the nature of the world. The first game was an unexpected treat but The Talos Principle 2 shows that developer Croteam can still create a delightful puzzle box even when we think we know what to expect.\nRead ourTalos Principle 2 review.\nDespite the name, Tactical Breach Wizards doesn't play very much like a tactical game like XCOM. Instead, this brain-tickling strategy game has distinct puzzle-like qualities, letting you glimpse ahead at possible outcomes and plan your perfect turn. The result is something along the lines of Into the Breach, albeit with a much funnier premise: You're a team of Operator-like wizards, each imbued with special powers. Those powers manifest both in the tactical gameplay and in a wide array of impactful upgrades, and the fantastical premise makes for some genuinely hilarious story moments.\nRead ourTactical Breach Wizards review.\nA rare comedy game that's actually funny, Thank Goodness You're Here takes the absurdism of good comedy improv and merges it with the interactivity of an adventure game. The animated adventure is on the short side--just around two hours by some estimates--but it uses that time to the fullest with surreal humor and an animated style that recalls great British comics like The Beano. Its sense of humor won't be for everyone, but it's a game that does what so few manage, even when they're trying their best: making us laugh.\nRead ourThank Goodness You're Here review.\nThe initial response toValorantwas that it's basically a mashup where Overwatch meets Counter-Strike--and yeah, that's pretty accurate. That's also a good thing, because Valorant draws on many of the strengths of those games to make something unique. It focuses on the round-based demolition-style game mode with two teams of five (attackers and defenders) on balanced maps with specific lanes and sightlines and an extremely fast time-to-kill. However, each agent (or character) has their own unique abilities that add another strategic layer to combat. Team composition plays a major role, and each agent affects what the team is capable of in each high-stakes situation. It's intense and demanding, but so rewarding.\nValorant is still early in its lifespan. But we've seen content updates and changes in its first year and it's been quite successful, so you can expect the game to get more support moving forward. If a competitive FPS with layered tactics, precise gunplay, and intense moments is your thing, Valorant is worth a try.\nSee ourValorant review.\nWarhammer 40,000: Space Marine was a cult classic when it released more than a decade ago, and at long last, its sequel has delivered just what fans of the bone-crunching action series have been waiting for. That means a return to the bloody, brutal combat from the first game, but with refinements that make it feel more fluid than ever. And as fans can attest, it uses the Warhammer tabletop license to great effect for world-building and a massive sense of scale, which goes nicely hand-in-glove with the crunchy combat that should appeal to fans and newcomers alike.\nRead ourWarhammer 40,000 Space Marine 2 review.\nOne of the best RPGs of all time,The Witcher 3: Wild Huntbrings the incredible story of Geralt of Rivia to a close. The Witcher 3 puts Geralt on a quest to find Ciri, a witcher in training who's like a daughter to him. He reconnects with old flames, friends, and adversaries as he searches far and wide for her. Of course, there's an abundance of side quests and characters to meet along the way, which will undoubtedly keep you busy for hours. Many of these quests require you to slay monsters, a witcher's main trade, and you'll have to prepare accordingly to defeat them by sword, witcher magic, and potions. All this--and we didn't even get into the two excellent expansions--makes The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt an essential PC game.\nSee ourThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt review.\nThe start of a new story arc is often the most exciting time for World of Warcraft, and the new War Within expansion is no exception. As the start of the Worldsoul Saga, War Within feels like a fresh start in many ways for the extremely long-running game. It's more approachable than ever, letting players engage as much or as little as they want to while still having an enjoyable experience. At the same time, WoW veterans will find all of the staples like Mythic dungeons and world quests intact, along with game-changing new features like Warbands and Delves.\nRead ourWorld of Warcraft: The War Within review.\nIn our effort to curate the very best in PC games, sometimes we trim older games to make room for our latest recommendations.

The Steam Deck has become a staple of PC gaming as the go-to portable solution for many PC players, and its popularity has seemingly inspired more portable PC manufacturers to join the market. Now you can enjoy a wide range of games, from the latest AAA releases to intriguing indie games, all in a convenient portable device.\nYou can read ourSteam Deck reviewto see what we thought of it, but more than likely, you're ready to dive in for yourself. As soon as you boot it up, you'll find your Steam library is intact, which is exciting, but not all games are created equal when it comes to playing them via Steam Deck.\nWe've rounded up a few dozen of the best games to play on Steam Deck, including major AAA hits, under-the-radar indies, and everything in between. In most cases, these games have already been declared as \"Deck Verified\" by Valve, meaning it's fully supported without any caveats. Plus aside from just technical verification, some games just feel great in portable form, so we've taken that quality into account as well. And while the Steam Deck is great for PC tinkerers, for the purposes of this list we've stuck with games that run natively through the Steam interface without any special hoop-jumping. These are our best of the best recommendations for Steam Deck, and we regularly reevaluate and update. That means even now in 2024, you can reference this as a resource for finding great games.\nIf you do want to expand your horizons, though, you can alsoinstall Epic Games Store on Steam Deckto broaden your library even more.

Soon you discover a few arcade machines sitting in storage in the back room and decide to open them up to the public. As you start to develop your business, you build up more and more cabinets, converting more of the laundromat to a burgeoning arcade business. While you need to manage your business, you can also play all of your own arcade machines to your heart's content. In effect, this makes Arcade Paradise a great minigame collection, letting you dabble in tons of different retro-styled games. And those play habits feed into the business management mechanics as well, as your performance in the arcade machines increases their popularity and profitability. The Steam Deck is a perfect fit, as you can while away the hours playing games or just check in for a day of managing your business while you're on the go.\n\nGet the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.\nBy signing up, you agree to the ourTerms of Useand acknowledge the data practices in ourPrivacy Policy.\nWe'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.\nCeleste is a challenging platformer with an emotional story to tell. It follows Madeline as she navigates her anxiety and depression--and it’s a story that’s arguably even more poignant today than it was in 2018. The narrative is best experienced without any spoilers, and it’s a journey that’s propelled to incredible heights thanks to its minimalistic graphics and a fluid movement system that works perfectly on Steam Deck. It only takes about eight hours to finish the journey, but completionists can stick around much longer if they want to uncover everything Celeste has to offer. It's a beautiful game that all platforming enthusiasts should play.\nGet the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.\nBy signing up, you agree to the ourTerms of Useand acknowledge the data practices in ourPrivacy Policy.\nWe'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.\nPart dungeon crawler, part simulator, Cult of the Lamb enlists you as the leader of a tribe of cultists as you try to gain the favor of a mystical being that saved you from death. Combat is fast and fluid, with levels randomly generated for replayability. There are also tons of ways to enhance your skills, giving you plenty of reasons to dive back in for another quest. When you’re not swinging swords or slinging spells, you’ll need to manage your cult in typical sim-game fashion. That means feeding your members, giving them jobs… and picking up their poop.\nGet the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.\nBy signing up, you agree to the ourTerms of Useand acknowledge the data practices in ourPrivacy Policy.\nWe'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.\nDon’t let its colorful, cartoon graphics fool you--Cuphead is a brutally difficult game. You play as the eponymous Cuphead as he battles a series of increasingly difficult enemies on his journey toward the Devil. Battles play out from a 2D perspective and take place in a single room, although each boss always manages to bring something new to the table. Beyond its striking graphics, Cuphead features some of the smoothest combat mechanics on this list, making it a blast to face off against each new villain (even if they destroy you just a few seconds later). Toss in a variety of unlockable weapons and abilities, multiple playable characters, and the stellar Delicious Last Course expansion, and it’s easy to see why Cuphead remains so popular more than five years after its release. It feels right at home on Steam Deck and is a must-play for anyone who likes challenging action games.\nGet the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.\nBy signing up, you agree to the ourTerms of Useand acknowledge the data practices in ourPrivacy Policy.\nWe'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.\nOn the surface, Dave the Diver is a cute adventure sim game in which you go spear fishing during the day and then bring your catches in at night to serve as the menu for a burgeoning sushi restaurant. But like the Big Blue Hole that you're diving into, there's unexpected depth here. Dave the Diver ends up being a wild hodge-podge of tons of different genre influences, incorporating lots of different activities as it tells its lengthy story. Still, the loop of catching fish, serving sushi, and using your profits to upgrade your gear is so easy and compelling it's a perfect fit for the Deck. The lovable Dave is a fun, rotund hero, and the game is also home to some of the biggest and best pixel cutscenes we've ever seen.\n\nDisco Elysium is so text-heavy that it can feel like you're actually holding a Kindle when playing it on a Steam Deck, but for fans of deep RPG experiences, it's exactly what you're probably looking for. The latitude for true role-playing is vast and the story goes places that are both smart and unpredictable. The painterly art style also looks great in handheld mode and may have fellow train passengers looking over to see what it is you're doing, which admittedly is a little awkward when you start the game hungover in your underpants.\nGet the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.\nBy signing up, you agree to the ourTerms of Useand acknowledge the data practices in ourPrivacy Policy.\nWe'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.\nA video game with a side of Eldritch horror, Dredge has you fishing the shores of Greater Marrow to reel in big catches, upgrade your boat, buy better supplies, and deal with panicked hallucinations. You know, normal fishing stuff! As the story unfolds you discover more about the horrific sea monsters that lurk below the surface, giving the whole thing a touch of lightly creeping spookiness.\n\nAfter nearly two decades of development, Dwarf Fortress is available on Steam (and playable on Steam Deck). The elaborate simulation game tasks you with growing a small settlement of dwarves into a thriving metropolis. There’s a ridiculous level of depth to the game, as you’ll need to gather resources, craft new gear, engage in combat, build structures, and contend with a dynamic weather system that can impact your city. It’s not for the faint of heart, but Dwarf Fortress is an intricate game that should please anyone itching for a comprehensive sim.\nGet the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.\nBy signing up, you agree to the ourTerms of Useand acknowledge the data practices in ourPrivacy Policy.\nWe'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.\nOur favorite game of 2022 recently got even better with the release of a massive expansion. Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree gives Tarnished a new set of tough-as-nails combat obstacles to overcome in an entirely new area, with a smart balancing system that recreates the feeling of progression without doing away with all your hard work in the main campaign. And it expands on the rich and layeredElden Ring lorein new and surprising ways.

Thanks to mods, Steam Deck the best place to play. Not only can you grind levels while binge-watching a show, but it looks and plays great, and you can even install mods to (for example) fix the font. If you can only get one, Final Fantasy 6 is an absolute masterpiece.\nGet the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.\nBy signing up, you agree to the ourTerms of Useand acknowledge the data practices in ourPrivacy Policy.\nWe'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.\nSteam is awash with cozy little farm sims inspired by Stardew Valley, and it takes something novel or well-executed to stand out from the crowd. Fields of Mistria is a bit of both. It boasts very familiar Stardew mechanics, but it speeds up the pace a good bit, making it much faster for Stardew veterans. It also sets itself apart with a magical anime-inspired setting and an array of magical powers to warn that will help you delve into dungeons, grow crops, and more. While it's only in early access so far, it's already a great way to relax and farm on Steam Deck.\n\nJust like the original Hades, Supergiant's anticipated follow-up is already a highly polished nail-biting action game on Steam Deck, even in early access. As Zagreus' sister, Melinoe, you cut your way through the underworld in a quest to defeat the Titan Chronos, the mythical figure behind the concept of time. While the trappings are familiar, Melinoe has a feel all her own, and new weapons and abilities make this feel noticeably different than its predecessor. If you'd rather have a game that's fully baked, the original Hades is still available and great on Deck as well.\n\nHitman 3, now rebranded as the World of Assassination with all of the content from the trilogy in tow, is the culmination of a half-decade of hard work from IO Interactive. But also, on Steam Deck, it's a diverse world tour of portable murder playgrounds, and that's pretty neat too. If you happen to have access to the earlier games in the Hitman reboot series, this third game houses every level, weapon, and ridiculous costume into one central hub, giving Hitman fans the totality of the franchise's best entries all in the palms of their hands. Plus the addition of the roguelike Freelancer mode gives the entire World of Assassination trilogy a new lease on life.\nGet the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.\nBy signing up, you agree to the ourTerms of Useand acknowledge the data practices in ourPrivacy Policy.\nWe'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.\nInto the Breach is one of the best-designed games in recent memory, and it's perfectly at home on Deck, thanks to its turn-based nature and bite-sized missions. As the previous Switch release demonstrated, the controls work perfectly well with a gamepad, and the screen here is well up to the task of displaying all of the information you need. Performance is great (it's not terribly demanding from a hardware perspective), and it's a terrific game that you can sink hours into at a time or occasionally glance at while watching something on TV.\nGet the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.\nBy signing up, you agree to the ourTerms of Useand acknowledge the data practices in ourPrivacy Policy.\nWe'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.\nThe mind-bending puzzle game Lorelei and the Laser Eyes will stick with you even while you aren't playing, so why not take it wherever you go? The game's many mysteries and secrets unfold with meticulous, interlocking detail, to the point where the game opens by encouraging you to keep a notebook in real life to help keep it all straight. The puzzles are challenging and rewarding, and will keep tickling your brain even when you put it down. But you won't want to.\n\nPersona series director Katsura Hashino has returned with his first new game since 2016, and it's a fantastic one. Metaphor: ReFantazio is similar structurally to the Persona series, but it features a new original storyline set in a fantasy world, and a wide array of characters to find and classes to unlock. The turn-based RPG combat unfolds beautifully into deep layers of strategy, and the story is an affecting meditation on the power of storytelling. It runs decently well on Steam Deck, letting you dungeon-crawl while on the go or watching TV. Metaphor: ReFantazio is one of thefew games in our history to earn a 10/10 review.\nRead ourMetaphor: ReFantazio review.\n\nOne of ourfavorite surprises of 2024, Minishoot Adventures blends retro Zelda-like exploration and adventuring with bullet hell shoot-em-up combat and movement mechanics. The combination may seem strange, right up until the moment you try it for yourself and find that it all gels together beautifully. Discovering the world and finding hidden secrets while also upgrading your arsenal to take on increasingly difficult swarms of enemies means there's always something interesting to see and do, whether you're exploring a tricky dungeon or just taking on a giant boss roaming the landscape. And if you miss playing Zelda games on handhelds like Game Boy, this is a perfect fit for the Steam Deck, letting you adventure on the go and soak in its colorful world.\n\nMonster Hunter Rise is another Switch game that eventually found a home on PC, making it well-suited for Steam Deck. The latest game in the franchise does quite a bit to move the series forward, with the Wirebug adding a new verticality to its maps and Rampage quests offering a chaotic break from your usual hunts. Beyond those changes, everything else that made Monster Hunter so popular is here in spades. Whether you enjoy heading out on hunts with a group of friends, meticulously crafting every piece of gear, or trying to slay beasts solo, Monster Hunter Rise is bound to impress.\n\nGet the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.\nBy signing up, you agree to the ourTerms of Useand acknowledge the data practices in ourPrivacy Policy.\nWe'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.\nMuch like Slay the Spire, which clearly inspired it, Monster Train is a game well-suited to quick bursts of gameplay. Because it's already available on Xbox, it features controller support, so controlling it on Deck is easy. But just as importantly, the action is readable on the screen, and its turn-based nature lends itself to the type of portable/toilet gaming that Deck enables. However you play it, the gameplay remains some of the very best in the roguelike deckbuilder genre, giving you a great deal of freedom in how you assemble your deck and combine cards from different factions to make each run feel distinct.\n\nGet the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.\nBy signing up, you agree to the ourTerms of Useand acknowledge the data practices in ourPrivacy Policy.\nWe'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.\nMost of the JRPG homages are riffing on classics from Square Enix, so it only makes sense that Square would make one of the best ones itself. Octopath Traveler 2 is the sequel to its experimental first game featuring eight heroes with their own backstories, and that core idea is still intact here. But OT2 is a vast improvement in every way. The repetitive process of gathering all eight party members has been streamlined, and the roles and abilities are more differentiated. Characters also now have differing daytime and nighttime skills, as well as Latent Abilities to use in combat. It may be a little slow to get started, but when all the mechanics and systems come together, it sings.\n\nThe Metroidvania genre fits like a glove on Steam Deck, and among those, one of the absolute best is the Ori series. The two games as a duology remain an immaculate and tightly-designed genre standout, arguably the best of the past decade. Taking that on the go is already possible on Switch and even Xbox Cloud Gaming, so you've maybe had opportunities to play it in handheld mode before, but if you missed it until now, the Steam Deck is the best of those handhelds thanks to it not requiring an internet connection like Xbox and its larger, nicer screen than Switch.\nGet the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.\nBy signing up, you agree to the ourTerms of Useand acknowledge the data practices in ourPrivacy Policy.\nWe'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.\nOne of the more clever Zelda-likes in recent memory, The Plucky Squire takes the top-down adventuring and merges it with a 3D world. As the main character of a children's book series, you're ripped from your storybook and cast into the real world of a little fan's bedroom. What follows is an inventive take on the genre, letting you manipulate the book and your surroundings in myriad ways to stop the plans of the dastardly Humgrump. The puzzles may start out easy, but they ramp up nicely and the stellar characters and world-building will keep you reading just one more page.\n\nThe metroidvania genre is popular for a reason, but it plays especially well on handheld platforms where you can alternate between focusing your attention and idly exploring while catching up with a bake-off. Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is no exception, and it's a great fit on Steam Deck for that reason. While it's not on Steam and thereforetakes a little extra setup, it's worth the work.\nAnd this is a particularly spectacular metroidvania. The combat is tight and responsive with an emphasis on counters and parries, and it uses an equipment system that lets you cater the action to your own play style. Exploration is vast and varied, thanks to a compelling world and white-knuckle platforming challenges. Every part of it harmonizes with the others, creating one of the best metroidvanias in recent years.\nWhile you do need an internet connection to play Sea of Thieves, it's still worthwhile to play when you aren't out and about. Past iterations of Rare's pirate sandbox have been less short session-friendly, but the team has taken strides to improve the game in that area, offering short and sweet daily challenges for all players and introducing new Sea Forts, which are meant to be challenged and won in as little as 15-20 minutes including the time it takes to sell all your loot. Sea of Thieves, like God of War listed earlier in this feature, is the kind of game that you once could only dream about playing on a handheld. But today the future has arrived by boat.\nGet the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.\nBy signing up, you agree to the ourTerms of Useand acknowledge the data practices in ourPrivacy Policy.\nWe'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.\nShin Megami Tensei V has come to PC, and it's a great fit on Steam Deck--which makes sense for an RPG that originated on the handheld-hybrid Nintendo Switch. The enhanced port, Shin Megami Tensei V Vengeance, adds loads of new story content and surprises for returning veterans, enhancing your relationships with human and demon characters, along with better navigation tools to find your way around. SMTV was already a deep and engrossing RPG, and it shines on Steam Deck.\n\nLike God of War, Spider-Man Remastered is a game that shows just how well Steam Deck can handle a big-budget, AAA experience. Marvel's Spider-Man came out in 2018, but its remastered version helped push the power of the PS5. The PC conversion can run even better with a significantly beefy PC, but the Steam Deck versionruns impressively well with the right settings. That means you can pack the great-looking visuals and all the web-swinging action into a portable package.\n\nStardew Valley might be the most popular farming game on the planet. Created almost entirely by a single developer (Eric Barone), the amount of content packed into its adorable, pixelated world is staggering. What starts as a simple quest to rebuild your grandpa’s farm quickly turns into something more. You’ll chat with the locals and form relationships, head out on dangerous mining expeditions, and watch as the quaint Pelican Town transforms through the seasons. Its laidback pace makes it a perfect fit for Steam Deck, giving you a chance to stick your hands in the dirt no matter where life takes you.\nGet the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.\nBy signing up, you agree to the ourTerms of Useand acknowledge the data practices in ourPrivacy Policy.\nWe'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.\nSteamWorld Heist 2 is only the second game in the SteamWorld series to warrant a numbered sequel, but it earns the distinction. The first SteamWorld Heist game was an inventive little take on the tactical game, with close-corridor combat that rewarded trick shots. SteamWorld Heist 2 retains that core, but builds out from it with a massive world to explore, larger stages, and more systems to manage, including a sophisticated class system. You can mix and match class abilities to create powerful combinations, making the strategy that much more rewarding.\n\nTactical Breach Wizards takes the tropes of a gritty SEAL Team 6-like operator squadron and gives it a hilarious and fantastical twist. Instead of marines, you're a tough band of magic users. The concept grants the ability to merge deep tactical gameplay with magical abilities, like the foresight to see the full outcome of your turns. Combat is like an interlocking puzzle, reminiscent of Into the Breach, while the characters and writing make it feel new and novel. The bite-sized stages are an especially great fit on Steam Deck, where you can breach and clear a single stage or settle in for longer sessions.\n\nAn audacious game experiment from a band of developers led by Spelunky's Derek Yu, UFO 50 is not a single game but a collection of 50 games. Presented as the long lost library of 8-bit games made by a developer called UFO Soft, the games range from shoot-em-up to racer to puzzle game and everything in-between. Some games are modernized takes on retro genres, while others are modern genres recontextualized through an 8-bit lens. The package is almost overwhelming in scope, consisting of both a massive collection of games and also serving as a meta-commentary on classic game development.\n\nThe follow-up to Void Bastards has similar roguelike hooks but a very different core gameplay loop. Instead of exploring creepy derelict space stations for a corporation, you're a band of space desperados putting together a posse. The roster of characters is inventive, with specialized powers that play like a hero shooter. The map plays out like a board game, with careful strategic planning to grab as much loot as you can before going head-to-head against a band of outlaws or a frightful boss. As you unlock new powers you can come up with some truly wicked combinations that feel great.\n\nAn early access game you can grab on the cheap, Vampire Survivors is very simple but shockingly fun. The single-stick shooter has you navigate around hordes of enemies while your weapons fire off automatically, building up experience to buy new weapon upgrades. The deceptively simple premise gets increasingly fiendish and chaotic as more enemies join the fray, and your weapon upgrades get ever-more destructive. It's enough to tempt you to play just one more round until you realize, oh whoops, it's 3 AM.\nGet the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.\nBy signing up, you agree to the ourTerms of Useand acknowledge the data practices in ourPrivacy Policy.\nWe'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.",

        "headline": "Meet The Three Starters In Pokemon Legends Z-A",
        "body": "During theFebruary 2025 Pokemon Presents show, Nintendo revealed the three starter Pokemon players can choose from inPokemon Legends Z-A: Chikorita, Tepig, and Totodile.\nSo far, that's all the information we have on the three starters. Pokemon Legends Arceus had alternate Hisuin final evolutions for its starters, each with a different typing compared to their original forms. It hasn't been confirmed whether the starters in Pokemon Legends Z-A will have alternate final evolutions as well.\nYou need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.\nWant us to remember this setting for all your devices?\nSign uporSign innow!\nBy clicking 'enter', you agree to GameSpot'sTerms of UseandPrivacy Policy\nenter\nNow Playing:Extended Look at Pokémon Legends: Z-A!\nHowever, Nintendo confirmed thatMega Evolutions will be making a return, so it's possible that the starters could receive those. There's been a precendent set with Mega Evolutions where some get new typing, such as Mega Ampharos being Electric/Dragon instead of pure Electric type and Pinsir becoming a Bug/Flying type when it Mega Evolves instead of staying pure Bug.\nLet's take a look at what we know about the three starters and what potential changes Legends Z-A could bring to them.\nChikorita is the Grass type starter from Generation 2, and is unfortunately the worst starter of its trio, as well as considered to be one of the worst starters historically. That's mostly due to the shallow pool of moves its final form, Meganium, can learn and its mediocre stats. However, a Mega Evolution or alternate form could drastically improve Meganium.\nNintendo could lean into Meganium's reptilian design and give it a secondary Dragon typing. Meganium already learns some Dragon type attacks, including Dragon Tail and Outrage, but a secondary Dragon type would also power them up by 50% due to STAB, or Same Type Attack Bonus. This would make Meganium more offensively viable.\nMeganium is more defensively oriented, and a Dragon typing would be a bit of a mixed bag. It would bolster its already impressive resistances to Water, Grass, and Electric moves. However, it would add Dragon and Fairy weaknesses.\nAn alternate form with the Grass/Fairy typing would give Meganium the best of both worlds, defensively and offensively. Fairy is regarded as one of the best types in Pokemon so far.\nA secondary Fairy type would gives Meganium an immunity to Dragon type attacks and new resistances to Dark and Fighting type attacks, while only adding one additional weakness to Steel type attacks. However, it would now take quadruple damage from Poison-type attacks instead of double. A secondary Fairy typing also cancels out Meganium's weaknesses to bug types too, making them only do neutral damage.\nOffensively, Fairy is a powerful type, hitting Dark, Dragon, and Fighting types for extra damage. However, Meganium will still struggle against Fire and Poison types, as they resist Fairy type attacks.\nTepig is the Fire starter from Generation 5 and its final evolution is Emboar, a Fire/Fighting type. With high offensive stats on both the physical and special sides of the spectrum, along with a versatile attacking movepool, Emboar doesn't need as much as a drastic change like Meganium. However, if Nintendo wants to switch up Emboar's typing in a Mega Evolution or alternate form, one possibility is Fire/Ground. Thematically, that would fit Emboar as a pig, rolling around in the mud.\nA secondary Ground typing might actually make Emboar worse, as it would take quadruple damage from Water type attacks and lose its Grass resistance. However, it would gain an Electric immunity. Either way, Emboar is fine as it is, and it's possible that it could retain its Fire/Fighting typing if given an alternate form.\nTotodile is Generation 2's Water type starter. Of the Johto trio, it's the most physically offensive, making it a popular option. Its final evolution is Feraligatr, which, like Emboar, also doesn't need a massive overhaul. Feraligatr is a pure Water type, so it's possible that it could gain a secondary typing.\nThe secondary typing that makes the most sense thematically for Feraligatr would be Dark, as that plays into Totodile's mischievous and playful nature. Plus, Feraligatr already learns plenty of Dark type moves such as Bite, Crunch, Fake Tears, Snarl, and Lash Out. A secondary Dark typing would also give its Dark attacking moves the STAB bonus.\nFeraligatr is reptilian, just like Meganium, so a Water/Dragon typing fits too. Feraligatr already learns moves like Dragon Claw, Outrage, and Dragon Dance. As long as a Mega Evolution or alternate form of Meganium isn't Grass/Dragon, Feraligatr can go down the route as a Dragon type, as I don't imagine Nintendo would want to double up on the Dragon typing for two starters.\nPokemon Legends Z-A is set tolaunch in late 2025 for Nintendo Switch. It'll have a new take on the traditional Pokemon battle system, including real-time elements with attack moves that have a certain amount of reach. Moving Pokemon out of the way will cause attacks to miss.",

Unlike PUBG, Prologue isn't a shooter or a battle royale. Instead, it's a survival game that pits players against bitterly cold elements and a treacherous environment. According to Greene, Prologue's extreme difficulty may cause some players to initially hate it, but he also believes they will eventually embrace it.\n\"I expect a lot of people will hate it,\" Greene toldPC Gamer. \"But that's ok if it elicits a reaction--that's all I want. People didn't get [Battle Royale] at first, but then they did. And I think it's the same with this, the goal here is creating these big, massive worlds for everyone. We already have a demo on Steam, and people understand what it is. So, if it causes a reaction, fantastic. I'll happily talk to them and go, 'Well, yeah, it doesn't handhold because that doesn't serve a purpose.'\"\nThe player's goal in Prologue is to live long enough to reach a weather station that's randomly located on an 8x8 km map. But in order to do so, players need to find the right gear and battle hunger and thirst as well. The game'sSteam pageindicates that there are \"millions\" of possible maps, so there isn't any single path to making it through alive. Regardless of whether the player succeeds or fails, the map will be different the next time they play. Prologue doesn't currently have a release date, but early access is expected to begin in the second quarter of this year. Players who want to get take part in Prologue's play testscan find more info here.\nNearly a year ago, Greene and his colleagues at PlayerUnknown Productions revealed that Prologue is part ofa long-term plan for three games, which also includes a title called Project Artemis. Meanwhile, PUBG publisher Krafton and Nvidia have unveiled plans forAI-powered teammates in PlayerUnknown's Battlegroundsthat can act like real people.

The game is in the works for Nintendo Switch and mobile devices--here's everything we know about it.\nPokemon Champions is a battle-focused game that features \"familiar mechanics\" from the series, including Pokemon types, abilities, and moves. The Pokemon Company said the game is aimed at newcomers and experienced players alike.\nThe game is all about battling, so players will need to come up with solid strategies to find success. It also supports cross-play between Switch and mobile devices, allowing players on either platform to duke it out online.\nPokemon Champions does not have a release date yet.\nPokemon Champions is not available to preorder, nor do we know if the game is free or paid.\nA trailer for Pokemon Champions debuted at the Pokemon Presents event on February 27. The trailer features a lot of live-action footage hearkening back to Pokemon's earliest days, showing kids battling by system link on Game Boy systems. The trailer also played into nostalgia by showing sequences of the popular N64 game Pokemon Stadium, which was all about battling. Pokemon Champions is an extension of this legacy and now allows players to do battle on Switch and mobile devices against each other, wherever they live, thanks to the internet. The trailer doesn't show much gameplay footage, though.\nWhat we do see is a 2v2 battle featuring Charizard and Cetitan on a massive battle stage. Check out the trailer below.\nPokemon Champions is in development for Nintendo Switch and mobile devices. The game supports cross-play between the two platforms. The Pokemon Company made no mention ofSwitch 2, but it's possible Pokemon Champions could be on Switch 2 throughbackwards compatibility.\nPokemon Champions utilizesPokemon Home, allowing players to bring their Pokemon from other games into Pokemon Champions. Pokemon Home is a cloud service for Switch and mobile devices that, when paired with a Nintendo Account, allows creatures in supported games to move between titles.\nSome of the titles currently supported are Pokemon Scarlet/Violet, Pokemon Sword/Shield, Pokemon Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl, and Pokemon Legends: Arceus.",

But things are going to get even wilder with a new gameplay mode.\nWithin Midnight Murder Club's new Wildcards mode, the battle royale in the mansion is upended by cards that can rewrite the laws of reality around them.

As long as at least one person owns Midnight Murder Club, they can invite five other people to play the game for free.\nPlayers can purchase the early-access game for $20 starting on March 13 on PS5 or PC via Steam, and the Guest Pass Edition will be available on day one for no additional cost.",

        "body": "Are you curious about Support Hunters, also known as the NPC companions inMonster Hunter Wilds? Well, you don't have to go at it alone when you're trekking across the Forbidden Lands. By default, your Palico cat companion will stay by your side. However, it's also possible to have other adventurers come to your aid. Our guide has all the details you need to help you with this particular gameplay mechanic.\nYou can summon companions whenever you're on a quest by using the SOS Flare. However, before we get to that part, it's important to discuss some related facets. Most of the information is already mentioned in ourcrossplay/multiplayer guide. But, when it comes to the SOS Flare itself, you might want to check a few options.\nYou can see the Monster Hunter Wilds SOS Flare settings by talking to Alma at your camp. The Settings panel has the following:\nThe SOS Flare Quest settings, meanwhile, lets you select from any type of monster or a specific monster, as well as the difficulty, quest type, platform, and more. You can then click on the SOS Flare Search button to find a player that's undertaking a particular mission or hunt.\nWhen you're out and about doing quests/hunts, you can use the SOS Flare via the radial wheel. Open the radial wheel and select the Actions tab. You should then see the SOS Flare icon as one of the available options.\nThe aforementioned Multiplayer Settings panel determines who's able to squad up with you--i.e. Players and Support Hunters, Only Players, or Only Support Hunters.\nLet's say you picked Players and Support Hunters, which is the default setting:\nThere are three AI companions in Monster Hunter Wilds, each specializing in a particular weaponry:\nNote that your teammates are smart enough that they'll be able to heal you and themselves at crucial times. They'll also focus on monster wounds if they're able to hit those spots. Likewise, they'll lay down traps, and feel disappointed in case creatures run away instead.\nSince AI companions are quite handy to have in battles, you might be wondering if there's any reason to disband your team in the middle of a fight. Well, you probably should if you're trying tocapture monsters.\nSince you can only capture beasts that have been severely weakened, it's imperative that they don't take too much damage that would prove to be fatal. As such, you must remove AI companions from your squad to prevent them from accidentally killing your target. You can do this by pressing the Start button -> Missions & Quests -> Support Hunter Info.\nYou may also reselect the SOS Flare action from the radial menu. However, we've noticed that this could bug out a few times, as teammates themselves won't leave automatically.\nThat does it for our Monster Hunter Wilds AI companions and SOS Flare guide. To learn more about squading up, you can take a look at ourcrossplay/multiplayer guide.\nNeed more tips as you continue fighting deadly creatures and venture into lands unknown?

        "headline": "Monster Hunter Wilds - How To Capture And Trap Monsters",
        "body": "Are you planning to capture monsters inMonster Hunter Wilds? While most objectives in the campaign require you to slay beasts that you encounter, there are a few where you're asked to incapacitate them instead. However, this process is a lot more involved. Fortunately, our guide here has all the tips that you need to help you with this task.\nCapturing a monster requires weakening them in battle, before using traps and tranquilizers. Sadly, the game doesn't really give you all the information that you need. Managing your inventory can also be an arduous task, leading to a bit of confusion.\nHere's how to make traps in Monster Hunter Wilds:\nBefore you head out, make sure you have multiples of any tranquilizer-type item as well. These include:\nHaving several Tranq Bombs should be fine. Just remember to have your Pitfall Trap/Shock Trap and Tranq Bomb in your item pouch.\nNow, all that's left is to battle a particular beast until they're severely weakened. You'll notice this once you see a notification at the right-hand side of your screen telling you that you should use traps. You'll also see the creature limping away to another location. Follow it and, in most cases, you'll see it resting due to its injuries.\nPlace a trap nearby and attack the monster once. Move near the trap to lure the creature toward you. Once the trap has been activated, use several of your Tranq Bombs via your item pouch until the beast is incapacitated.\nNote:Once a creature has been weakened it's important that you dismiss anyAI companionthat's with you on a quest, since the damage that they deal might kill the monster instead. You can dismiss companions by pressing Start and going to the Missions & Quests tab. Then, Select Support Hunter Info and remove the AI teammates from your party.\nWhen you capture a monster in Monster Hunter Wilds, you still receive materials, in addition to regular quest rewards. The difference between this process and slaying a creature is that you won't get to carve its carcass. Also, the vast majority of main quests simply require you to \"hunt\" or \"slay\" beasts. You wouldn't need to worry about capturing creatures alive except in certain missions that have this particular requirement.\nThat does it for our guide on how to trap and capture monsters in Monster Hunter Wilds.\nNeed more tips as you continue fighting deadly creatures and venture into lands unknown?

The steps you take to join with random strangers or team up with friends are rather different, though, as Wilds makes you jump through several hoops to add friends to your in-game list. Full cross-play might be a big step forward for Monster Hunter, but if you're holding out for cross-progression as well, you'll have to keep waiting.\nWe've broken down how Monster Hunter Wilds' multiplayer works below, including what you need to do to play with friends. For more on what to expect, check out ourMonster Hunter Wilds reviewandwhen Wilds unlocks.\nMonster Hunter Wilds supports cross-play between PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5. Since it has cross-play turned on automatically, you don't have to do anything special to get started.\nYou need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.\nWant us to remember this setting for all your devices?\nSign uporSign innow!\nBy clicking 'enter', you agree to GameSpot'sTerms of UseandPrivacy Policy\nenter\nStill, even if cross-play is enabled by default, you might be wondering if it can be turned off. For instance, you might be playing on console and you're worried about encountering cheaters/modders on PC. Well, you can disable cross-play, but only from the main menu. Simply go to Options -> Game Settings -> Cross-play to disable the option.\nMoreover, Monster Hunter Wilds has several options related to multiplayer and joining quests. However, you can disable all online and multiplayer-related content via the main menu as well. Go to Privacy -> Acquisition of Personal Information:\nThere are separate processes for playing in groups of random players or joining with friends. When you join or post a quest, Monster Hunter Wilds puts you in a lobby with up to 100 other players. You can join any posted quest or wait for others to join yours.\nAdding friends takes a few more steps. You need to invite friends from your platform's friend list or use a link code that Wilds generates for you. Once they've joined your party, you can add them to your Hunter Friends list by doing the following:\nInviting specific players or pals from other platforms comes with additional steps.\nAssuming you've grouped up with other people, you can post a quest by speaking to Alma at your camp. Your squadmates will then receive a notification and a prompt to join up.\nAnother related facet when it comes to Monster Hunter Wilds cross-play and multiplayer involves the SOS Flare. We discuss a lot of details in ourAI companions/SOS Flare guide, but here's the gist:\nCapcom said Monster Hunter Wilds will not support cross-save progression. All DLC, story progress, and character data will remain locked to the platform where you first start playing Monster Hunter Wilds, so if you pick it up on a different platform, you'll have to start over.",

The city will feature multiple open areas for exploration, including rooftops--which players can jump off and glide back down to the ground--and Wild Zones where new Pokemon can be battled and caught.\nWe see multiple Pokemon encounters during the trailer, some of which resemble the turn-based battling featured in many previous games, as well as the \"throw a Poke Ball without battling\" mechanic seen in Legends: Arceus. Along with those came a new type of battling system where distance and movement play a key role, as attack moves have a certain amount of reach, and moving a Pokemon out of the way will cause the attack to miss.\nPokemon Legends Z-A will also mark the return of Mega Evolutions--which originated in Pokemon X and Y for the Nintendo DS.

        "body": "The Exploration Age in Civilization 7 is all about expanding your reach across the map while contending with rivals and allies at home and abroad. Building on the foundation you laid in theAntiquity age, this is your chance to get ahead and start looking at opportunities to set yourself up for eventual victory in the Modern age.\n\nOf course, your choice of Exploration age civ is going to be extremely impactful. There are eleven Exploration age civs in the game, all with different traits and strengths. You may not have access to all of them every game, as they each have specific unlock requirements, but no matter how many options you're dealing with, our Civ 7 Exploration civs tier list can help you make that crucial decision.\nNote: YourCiv 7 Leaderwill provide further buffs to your playthrough and when paired with the right civilization, may alter their power with strong synergies. This Tier List is ranked purely on the power of each Civilization at its standalone base - so take into account how a civ will interact with your Leader when choosing.\nS-tier- Mongolia, Shawnee, Norman\nA-tier- Chola, Ming\nB-tier- Abbassid, Hawai’i, Inca, Songhai\nC-tier- Majapahit, Spain\nThese are the best of the best Civilization 7 has to offer. Whether it's their particularly strong military units, or their very powerful resource access, you can largely dominate maps with these choices.\nMongolia is the perfect continuation of the Persia civilization’s ideals from the Antiquity Age - namely, bash your head against other civilizations aggressively to take their land. There’s nothing here that’s flashy, but as a show of brute strength, you will become the bully of a map when taking control of Mongolia.\nOne interesting thing about Mongolia is that it directly feeds into the Military Legacy Path by providing boosts for the Non Sufficit Orbis path. The more you take as well, the stronger your army grows with Cavalry, so you can snowball maps pretty hard, especially with the Keshig and Noyan adding extra firepower. If you are planning to go for a Military victory, Mongolia is a direct path to get there.\nLearn more about theCiv 7 Victory Types and How to Win!\nThe Shawnee unique trait of Nepekifaki is easy to keep active, as most Settlements will likely end up being built around rivers. By doing so, you will get a nice boost of Food, helping your population grow, and allowing you to grab even more land. You have to avoid having cities not on Navigable Rivers, but even in cases where you have a Town not on one, you can just leave it as a Town.\nElsewhere, the Kispoko Nena’to could become one of the strongest Infantry in the game under the right circumstances. If you get your hands on multiple Unique Resources, they will become very, very strong. This makes Shawnee a military force to be reckoned with, but also one that will be expanding its borders through population growth too.\nSetting off to Distand Lands? Find outhow to raise the settlement cap in Civ 7.\nThe Normans are a great option for almost anyone in the Exploration Age as they provide buffs that feed into most of the age's Legacy objectives. Land Units receiving +1 movement when embarked is going to be super useful when trying to get a foothold in Distant Lands. Not only will you be able to get Settlers over faster, but you can move your Military Units quicker so you won’t be defenseless after you arrive. This makes them very nimble during this Age, which is surprisingly valuable.\nThey are also supported by a very good Cavalry Unit in the Chevaler, which will be strong against armies that rely heavily on Infantry units. By just creating the Unique District, the Donjon, you’ll get free one of those units, making the Normans a military force to be feared. On top of this, the Sokeman Army Commander gives new Towns automatic City walls, which feed into both the power of the Bailey and Motte.\nLearn more about the variousCivilization 7 Unitsyou can train and use.\nThe Exploration Age is where a strong Navy can dominate, and the Chola have access to some serious firepower in this regard. Kalam can attack twice in many instances, while the Ottru debuffs enemy units too. When used in tandem, there’s not many who will be able to withstand a sea-based assault like this.\nThe Chola also get access to a lot of Trade buffs, increasing the number of Trade Routes they can establish, and also their radius. You should be able to build quite a treasury and maintain decent relations with other civilizations with this. That said, the Chola will struggle to keep up with Science, so pacts will be important to stay relevant. On top of that, they are also not a civilization to pick if you ended up building a very landlocked empire in the Antiquity Age, as access to coasts is fairly essential.\nDiscoverhow to set up a Civ 7 trade routeusing merchants.\nThe Ming civilization has enormous upsides. With some careful management, they can absolutely run away with technological advances in the Exploration Era, as they get a straight 50% buff to all Science in your Capital. However, you can end up hurting yourself. You get -15 Science for every Social Policy, so you will want to lean on Tradition wherever possible. If you manage this, though, the benefits are enormous.\nThe Ming Great Wall is a versatile building offering great fortification defense, as well as Culture and Gold. The Mandarin is also a great unit for a quick burst of Gold when building Roads, and while not the strongest military unit in the Age, the Xunleichong is a good option if you can station them on featureless terrain.\nIn this tier, you'll find good civilizations with a decent amount of benefits. They're generally strong, and may be situationally extremely powerful, but tend to be more specialized.\nThe Abbassid civilization can be excellent, and when used correctly, it offers a variety of benefits. But to get these benefits, you’re going to need to manage your Settlements and properly set them up. You get 30 Gold for each Rural Population of a city whenever you create a specialist. You can also boost Science quite a lot by completing the Ulema District, providing +1 Science for all Specialists in the city. The Mamluk are also decent and can become quite powerful defensively. The Cavalry gains +1 Combat Strength for every Urban population in a Settlement while stationed there.\nThis civilization is an excellent option if you’re confident in producing and placing Specialists while managing districts. However, if you’re less confident in how these mechanics work, many other, plug-in-and-play civilizations require less finessing.\nPlaying Abbassid? Brush up onhow to use Civ 7 Specialists.\nThe Hawai’i civilization is a great choice for those who find themselves by the ocean. Considering the Exploration Age is all about getting in your boats and finding Distant Lands, this can synergise nicely. The Moananuiakea trait means you gain 25 Culture each time a Settlement expands in Marine Terrain. You’ll also get +1 Happiness on Fishing Boats. Neither is an enormous buff, but if you can incorporate a lot of sea into your borders, this will undoubtedly add up.\nElsewhere, the Leiomano is a very solid Infantry unit, getting a +3 combat buff against Infantry and Cavalry Units. Considering that’s the majority of land units they will be going up against, it’s just a nice edge that doesn’t require a complex initiation. The Lo’i Kalo is also just a solid producer of Food, Production, and Culture in most cases, making it a versatile building. There’s nothing particularly flashy or hard to use about Hawai’i past just being on a coast, but the civilization has a nice slew of solid benefits that are easy to get consistent value out of.\nThe Inca civilization is best utilized with a bit of forethought, but if you build correctly, you can do a lot of really good things with them. Choosing this civilization is best if you’ve built your borders with them in mind in the Antiquity Age. This is because their power comes from utilizing mountain tiles. If you built your cities around big ranges though, you will get a lot from the Incas.\nThis civilization lets you work Mountain terrain, and get extra food and production when doing so. On top of that, the Terrace Farm improvement is just a significant +6 to Food, meaning you will be able to expand your borders even faster. The Chasqui scout is also great for exploring Distant Lands, getting extra movement, and ignoring mountains and rough terrain, allowing you to chart new continents really fast. That all said, if you don’t have a lot of mountains within your lands, you’re going to be missing out on a lot of value, making them quite situational.\nLearn more about the differentTown typesyou can establish in Civ 7.\nThe Songhai are all about making money. If you’re looking to make Gold, this Civilization will do it for you - that said, it’s relatively one-dimensional. The Tarikh al-Sudan trait that gives them +2 Resource Capacity in Cities on Navigable Rivers is nice as those slots do come at a premium. Also, the Caravanserai improvement as well as the Tajiro merchant are very good Gold generators.\nThat being said, there is no real variety here. Other yields like Influence, Happiness, Culture, and Science might struggle. Of course, you can buy these buildings in towns with all your Gold, but expect some difficulty keeping up with everyone else. Also, the Gold Bangles Infantry, which gets +5 combat on Resource tiles, is a decent defensive option if you set up like that specifically, but considering you’re at the whims of the map, and not your Settlement placement, it can be a little awkward to utilise fully.\nWhile not bad civilizations, these are often more situational civilizations or civilizations that require a unique playstyle that might be best for more experienced players.\nThe Majapahit are a decent choice if you live in a relatively varied landscape. The Meru provides Happiness on Mountains, Wonders, and even more on Natural Wonders. The Candi Bentar is a great producer of Culture on Coasts, Rivers and Wonders. That said, it can be hard to really incorporate all of that, and even if you build the Pura district by combining both, receiving 1 relic isn’t often going to tip the scales for you. On top of that, the Negara does let you have an extra Specialist, but again, this likely isn’t going to be a massive deciding factor for you.\nThe Majapahit is not without merit. Altogether, it can be a decent producer of Culture if the circumstances are right, and if you get more Puras it can be a decent source of Relics. The Cetband Navel unit is excellent too, getting +5 combat strength against enemy Naval Units is strong in an Age when a lot of sailing is happening. That said, the Majaphat lack a little cohesiveness, and can be a touch situational, making it tougher to get full value out of them at all times.\nIf you're going for the Cultural Legacy Path, you'll need to knowhow to get Relics in Civ 7!\nSpain is not a bad civilization by any means. They provide a lot of avenues for Gold, with the Plaza Quarters being a big source of it if you make a lot of Settlements in Distant Lands. However, outside of that, and considering a couple of other Civilizations have access to powerful Gold-generating facets, there’s not much that really sets Spain apart.\nThe cost reduction on turning Towns into Cities from the Siglo de Oro is nice to have but probably isn’t going to have a massive impact on how your Age goes. The Tercio is also a good unit against militaries that have gone a little too hard on Cavalry but are outpaced by many other strong military units of other civilizations in this Age.\nPatrick is a freelance journalist with over 13 years of experience who loves going deep on games and getting into their systems.

        "headline": "Neighbors: Suburban Warfare Is a Sinister Multiplayer Game With a Friendly Face",
        "body": "I’m confident that even the most locked in gamer hasn’t played something quite like Neighbors: Suburban Warfare. You can see some influences and similarities to other games - it has the arcadey shooter feel of Team Fortress, the light tactical base building of a survival game, the slapstick physical humor of a Goat Simulator or Just Die Already - all in one anarchic post-WW2 package. I had a couple of hands-on sessions with it, navigating its team-based homewrecking action, and though its untraditional format will make for some rough first minutes, it was hard not to walk away from the over the top bedlam with a smile.\n\nThere’s maybe no more antithetical setting for Neighbors: Suburban Warfare’s team-versus-team base-building combat romp than the idyllic, prosperity-pilled 1950’s American suburbs. But developer Invisible Walls wanted to make a game that was bright and colorful and would be striking at first glance and approachable to a broad audience. “We also had this idea of the neighborhood feud element from day one,” art director Andreas Bech explained. “And for most of the team, the post-war optimism of the ‘50s and ‘60s resonates with that.”\nThe irony of the collective drive towards the presentation of perfectionism leading to individual households going so mad with power that they would sabotage their peers because they look like they might be doingtoowell was the bedrock for every iteration of Suburban Warfare. What started off as a game where players would decorate their houses and vandalize their opponents to win top prize at a sort of house pageant turned into a more raucous skirmisher “after it became apparent that [that version of the PvP and PvE] didn't mix,” Invisible Walls CEO David Heldager revealed. “Everyone just wanted to destroy the other’s house.”\nAnd so their game morphed into the squad-based hybrid shooter and base-builder that I got my hands on for around an hour with the dev team. Our goal was pretty clear: we must infiltrate the enemy abode and destroy its “essential items” like the stove, toilet, and master bed. This is much easier said than done, of course, as there are so many layers of variables and tactics that come into play during each match that chaos is unavoidable.\nIt all starts with character selection. Each of the eight available neighbors has their own signature starting items and special abilities, like the Rosie the Riveter-inspired Kim and her throwable pipe wrench that can build a special autonomous oil-spitting turret to defend her home when she’s out pillaging. There were two available neighborhoods (maps) to choose from, each dictating where neutral objectives will be, and each team can choose a specific house layout to use, each floorplan having its own different entrances and essential item locations. This felt like a lot to try to understand up front, but even though there is a county fair's worth of variability in each match, the pursuit of “the perfect competitive combination” is a bit of a fool’s errand.\n“We wanted to be different in that this is the game you play when you’re not playing [something more competitive like] Marvel Rivals,” David said when I asked the team if and how Suburban Warfare could appeal to the types of gamers that prefer a more sweaty PvP experience. “The tone is lighthearted and we designed it for lightheartedness, but we do find people start getting very competitive after like three or four games,” Andreas added. The design consensus among them was to focus on making cool things first, and balancing them second. “We were not experts on PvP and balancing when we started this game,” game director Sebastian Bevensee said, explaining that unfamiliar traps and weapons that will inevitably knock new players out will feel overpowered until they realize that just about everything is that strong on purpose. The goal is to make everything feel impactful so long as you hit with them, and encourage everyone to be a consequential playmaker when the opportunity presents itself.\nAfter choosing your avatar to commit minor crimes with and agreeing to what kind of house you’re going to defend with your teammates (and where you’ll be defending it from your opponents), it's time to get to the dirty business of targeted vandalization. Your team of up to four must build all manner of tools, traps, and defenses in order to turn away your annoying nosey neighbors while also empowering your team to be even more annoying and nosier. Buying tools or basic fortifications costs money that you earn slowly over time but in lump sums by knocking out enemies. More valuable options become available when you upgrade your workbench with spare resources found at the construction site, located in a neutral point on every map. After buying starter tools - usually the crowbar since it helps destroy objects faster - every round of Suburban Warfare I played started with a full team sprint towards these wayward crates.\nMy team was pretty good at making it out of the ensuing brawls with a couple of resources without taking too many casualties, but the early moments where no one has special gear is where I felt the character selection and team compositions the most. Big bruisers like Chad can hold the front line and distract the enemy long enough for someone else to snatch resources right out from under you. Or sneaky little bastards like this Dennis the Menace x Kevin McCallister hybrid who can avoid the melee completely and instead start attempting to break into your home while you're gone. Neighbor’s individual special abilities remain impactful throughout the match, but ones with definite strengths above and beyond those never feel stronger than those first few minutes.\nAfter taking the resources back we focused on locking down our house, lining the vulnerable parts of our fence with bear traps, repairing damaged doors and windows, and even setting up a small oil rig to turn our passive trickle of money into more of a sprinkler. All the while, both sides were taking turns poking at one another, sneaking to back doors and windows while causing a ruckus on the front lawns by either running up personally and trying to catch a poor homemaker slipping, or ordering more bombastic offensives on the enemy in the form of delivery trucks that speed through the cul de sac and lob boxes full of fireworks at your foes. And then, after around four minutes of game time, night fell on our pitched battle. Besides making the battlefield darker, it also signals that the nocturnal guard dog of each house is up and prowling, and it is devastatingly good at hunting down any enemy that steps onto your property and eliminating them with extreme prejudice, until the sun rises and the chaos ensues again.\nExchanges between squads, be they in the streets or each other’s living rooms, were always tense because the more dangerous weaponry, like a sledgehammer or a pressurized cannon that shoots oranges, can do players in quickly. And yet the hammer is slow and the cannon, one of the few ranged options in the game, is hard to aim and slow to fire and reload. This was all by design. “We are always encouraging people to be more up front and close,” Sebastian explained, pointing out that their focus on keeping the most effective and easy to use offense as close-ranged options forces players to engage with one another instead of trying to take sniper positions or control the field from afar.\nThat doesn’t constrain their weapon options from walking more on the wild side, though. Many of the options operate as you assume they would, but then there are some tricky takes on household items, like the aforementioned vacuum that can suck enemies into bashing range. You can build a chicken coup and toss their eggs at foes to blind them. With enough investment into your workbench you can get access to my favorite option so far: a seagull that you can fly to bomb enemies like a Call of Duty kill streak reward. The cartoony madness is lots of fun, moment to moment.\nDuring the course of these cycles across the rounds I played, the biggest issue I found was feeling like I wasn’t doing the right thing at the right time. I wasn’t searching for the most efficient ways to spend money and resources so much as feeling like I was actively contributing to the overall goal of compromising the enemy's home to a permanent end. Picking up the basics is easy, but learning how to know when to go all out on the enemy or when to pull back to defend was something that I couldn’t intuit in my brief time with Neighbors. David agreed. “Our main struggle is, ‘How do you explain the meta in a game like this?’” They’ve seen playtesters grow into sharp and knowledgeable players over half a dozen games or so, so it's not impossible to let go of worry and embrace the madness.\nSo is Neighbors: Suburban Warfare the next big party shooter? I’m not sure how it will stand up against genre juggernauts, but it will certainly stand out. Two geezers shaped like Mr Magoo and Evel Knievel exchanging plunger crossbow fire in the street only to get hit by a delivery truck tossing bombs into the front yard is a scenario you aren’t going to find in your current favorite team shooter. And Invisible Walls likes it that way. They don’t want to replace your favorite game, they just want to be the Mad Men-coded funhouse you spend your off time in.\nI’m confident that even the most locked in gamer hasn’t played something quite like Neighbors: Suburban Warfare. You can see some influences and similarities to other games - it has the arcadey shooter feel of Team Fortress, the light tactical base building of a survival game, the slapstick physical humor of a Goat Simulator or Just Die Already - all in one anarchic post-WW2 package.

        "headline": "Valve's MOBA Shooter Deadlock Cuts a Lane, Spurring Reactions From Its Playerbase",
        "body": "Deadlock, the MOBA-meets-hero shooter mash-up from Valve, has been in a perpetual state of quiet build-up over the last year. But that hasn't stopped Valve from making massive, tectonic changes, like cutting down the number of lanes.\n\nYesterday, February 25, Valve publishedthe Map Rework Update for Deadlock. Chief among the changes was a redesign of Deadlock's core map around three lanes, rather than four. For those who don't dabble in MOBAs, these \"lanes\" are the central focus of gameplay; minions spawn at each team's base and surge down them, attempting to push the battle lines into each other's territory. Players take up residence in the lanes, fighting over the killing blow on minions to accrue money and experience they can use to power up.\nIt's one big game of tug-of-war, and reducing the number of figurative ropes from four to three has pretty drastic implications. It cuts down on one source of resources and reduces the number of fronts in the ongoing battle. It also means, for the 6-on-6 battles of Deadlock, that previously \"solo\" lanes will more often be duo lanes.\n\"Definitely going to be missing four lanes,\" one commentersaid on the Deadlock subreddit. \"I always thought that was one of the more unique aspects of Deadlock. Oh well, learn and adapt I guess.\"\nDespite some of the worried hyperbole over map shifts, there is a degree of trust — though not absolute or unflinching — and voicing measured feedback. \"It’s just a test guys chill,\" saidone commenter. \"If it works well it stays, if it doesn’t work then it will go away like mid urn.\" (A former game mechanic.)\nA decent amount of this trust stems from the fact that IceFrog, thepseudonymous developer behind Dota 2, is also working on Deadlock. Dota 2 is fairly infamous formassive overhauls and game-changing updates, wiith patch notes that felt like getting whiplash from spreadsheets.Old memes stretching back to the early days of Dota 2, encouraging players to trust in IceFrog's changes, have already been resurfaced for modern Deadlock players.\n\"Dota 2 has seen so many massive overhauls and changes and the game still thrives,\" acommenter said. \"As long as Deadlock's core gameplay doesn't drastically change (which definitely isn't a guarantee since its currently in development) then people will play the game regardless.\"\nMap changes aside, Valve took the wrench to a lot of Deadlock with this recent update. Soul Orbs, which are released from enemies upon death and can be shot by players to either secure their rewards or partially deny them from the enemy team, also got a hefty rework. Sprinting has been tuned, flex slots and economic considerations have been made to adjust for the new three-lane set-up, and there's the usual slew of quality-of-life and hero changes.\nFor some, especially the long-time Dota players, Deadlock's update feels par for the course. (Dota 2 evengot its own massive overhaul just last week.) While it will certainly shift the way players approach the game, part of the long-term appeal of a MOBA like Deadlock is the ways the game shifts over time, in response to both developer changes and community reactions. If handled well, it can result in years of vibrant competition. If not, well, hopefully there's a rewind button somewhere. History has shown that not all major updates are made in stone, even forhuge games like Overwatch.\nWith not even a week out yet in Deadlock, players will need to dig in and figure out just how the reduced lanes shifts the game, suss out the intended change, and find new ways to open up gameplay through it. On at least one positive note, players with solo lane anxiety can breathe a sigh of relief.\nDeadlock is still flagged as being in early development, and Valve warns players it's filled with \"temporary art and experimental gameplay.\" Access is currently limited to friend invite via playtesters, and there's no release window announced.\nEric is a freelance writer for IGN.",

All three titles will be available to download for Essential, Extra, and Premium members starting March 4.\nIt’s a notably strong month for PlayStation Plus subscribers of all tiers, but the main highlight here is EA and BioWare’sDragon Age: The Veilguard. The big-budget RPG launched October 31, only four months ago, and received strong reviews from critics (we gave it a9/10 in our review).\nButEA saidthe latest Dragon Age title wasn’t able to “resonate with a broad enough audience in this highly competitive market,” and BioWare saw a restructure and layoffs. Apatch from late last monthdelivered quality-of-life changes and bug fixes and signalled the end of content support.\nEven if RPGs aren’t your thing,Sonic Colors: Ultimateprovides a rush of speed, action, and, well, color. This remaster of one of the more beloved entries in the Sonic franchise launched in 2021, adding more content to blaze through as players refamiliarized themselves with the Blue Blur’s sci-fi-inspired abilities and story. We gave it an8/10 in our review.\nRounding out the pack is a collection of 13 remasters of Konami’s classic TMNT spinoff games. It’s a bundle that includes new and improved versions of beat ‘em up titles like TMNT: Turtles in Time, the original TMNT arcade game, and more, all under one roof. Although it wasn’t without its issues,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collectionstill provides PlayStation Plus subscribers with an easy way to experience old-school fan favorites.\n“TMNT: The Cowabunga Collection is a treasure trove of Turtle games, but our online experience was barely functional when matchmaking,” we said in our7/10 review. “Couch co-op fares a lot better, but some may notice an increased input delay over the originals. All said this is still a great collection for fans.”\nPlayStation Plus subscribers can add Dragon Age: The Veilguard, Sonic Colors: Ultimate, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection from next week until April 1, 2025. While we wait for the March titles to drop, be sure to nabFebruary’s PlayStation Plus games, which include Payday 3, High On Life, and Pac-Man World Re-Pac, before they disappear from the service next week.\nMichael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

        "body": "Keen-eyedMarvel Rivalsplayers have spotted an in-game reference that seems to suggest that Season 2’s theme and characters will revolve around the classic Marvel comics storyline, the Hellfire Gala.\n\nInformation on what NetEase Games could be planning for its next seasonal content drop was first spotted and sharedby Reddit user DynamiteDynamo10. Their post includes a screenshot of the \"Plans Within Plans\" Gallery Card included in the in-game event page in Season 1, containing dialog and story details tied to the current season. It’s a lengthy entry in what is already a game brimming with lore, but what’s interesting is how it ends.\n“Now, if you will excuse me, Doom has a gala to attend,” the post concludes.\nIt’s not exactly an all-out reveal that Season 2 will follow a story set around Marvel’s well-known gala event, but it is at least a suspicious mention that you’ll need to dig to find. Meanwhile, other players are using Doctor Doom’s gala reference as fuel to the fire that are the rumors that X-Men regular Emma Frost will soon join Marvel Rivals.\nSeemingly leaked Emma Frost voice lines wereshared online by X0XLeakthis past weekend, kicking off speculation that the diamond-skinned character could be added sooner rather than later. She also happens to play a part in the original Hellfire Gala storyline along with a laundry list of other Marvel icons. Voice lines like this are suspicious on their own, so coupled with the reference to the gala, these details have some players already plotting out how Emma Frost could break apart the current Marvel Rivals meta.\nWhile the development makes sense for many, others are saying the reference isn’t enough to confirm which Marvel names will join the Marvel Rivals roster in Season 2. If the next content drop, which is expected to arrive mid-April, is truly set to add content themed around the Hellfire Gala, then the Gallery Card is the first time NetEase has said anything official on the matter. So, even if we assume Season 2 centers around the Hellfire Gala, the story could include Emma Frost or go a different path completely.\nMeanwhile, so many other players have spent the entirety of Marvel Rivals Season 1’s vampire-themed romp expecting to see Blade join as the next playable character following multiple in-game appearances. Some have suggested that this could mean we see the Daywalker join for one half of the season while Emma joins in another, while others theorize that Emma may not join until Season 3. At the least, NetEase has saidit plans to deliver at least one new character every half-season, so Season 2 is sure to surprise players one way or another.\nAll of these details are based purely on speculation; we won’t know what NetEase has planned for at least another few weeks. Until the team has more to share about the future of Marvel Rivals, you can check outhow it chose to include a reference to an infamous Moon Knight memeas part of its mid-season update. You can also read up onsome of the other rumored heroesandwhy NetEase had to tell fans that it isn’t actually planting leaks.\nMichael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

The lesser-known martial arts RPGJade Empirecould have made the list too, though it sounds like its chances were spoiled thanks to a rough launch window and some bad advice from Microsoft.\n\nOver on theMy Perfect Console podcast(as spotted byGamesRadar), BioWare co-founder Dr. Greg Zeschuk discussed one of the regrets he'd had; specifically, launching Jade Empire at the end of the original Xbox's life cycle. The RPG hit Xbox on April 12, 2005, several months before the November 22, 2005 launch date for the Xbox 360. And according to Dr. Zeschuk, Microsoft advised BioWare to launch it then, rather than later.\n\"And Microsoft's like, 'no no, you should release it now, right at the end of the cycle, because it's a great time,'\" Dr. Zeschuk said. \"It was like, the worst advice. Like, absolute moronic advice from them. It was the stupidest thing ever.\"\nIf BioWare had pushed the project back a bit, putting Jade Empire on the Xbox 360, Dr. Zeschuk speculated that the studio could have \"rezzed it up,\" and had it ready to go. It might have cost some more money, but could have put Jade Empire in a better place.\n\"Give us six months, give us the chance to make it a launch title for the 360 and we'd have another franchise,\" Dr. Zeschuk said. \"And I mean, who knows where... like, I just think it would have been a way more successful product at the beginnning of a cycle, versus the end.\"\nGranted, the BioWare co-founder also acknowledged that the combat of Jade Empire \"wasn't as good as it could have been.\" In theory, though, it would have given Microsoft an RPG closer to, or even within, the 360's launch window. While the Xbox 360 had games like Condemned: Criminal Origins, Perfect Dark Zero, Project Gotham Racing 3, and the immaculately titledPeter Jackson's King Kong: The Official Game of the Movie, it was short on role-playing games.\nThe Xbox 360 would become a defining console for BioWare, especially its current era. Mass Effect and Dragon Age would both launch on the Xbox 360, eventually becoming the dual pillars of modern BioWare. Could Jade Empire have been a third? There were oncerumors of a Jade Empire 2, andvisions of a canceled spiritual successor to Jade Empiresurfaced a few years ago.\nAs it is now, BioWare is in a precarious position. Afterlayoffs and several project lead departures,Dragon Age: The Veilguard fell short of Electronic Arts' expectations. The studio wasrestructured earlier this year, with some developers moved to other EA projects, while others were laid off.\nNow, all of BioWare's efforts are pinned on one of those aforementioned pillars: the next Mass Effect.Announced at The Game Awards 2020, we'veseen only a few teasersin the years since. Whether Jade Empire might have offered another pillar or not, it's still interesting to consider how an Xbox 360 launch might have changed the games' appraisal, and BioWare's history as a whole.\nEric is a freelance writer for IGN.",

        "body": "Nearly three years after the project wasfirst announced, IGN Fan Fest can exclusively reveal the lead voice stars for the all-new scripted audio series Star Trek: Khan, which will stream on all major podcast platforms later in 2025.\n\nLost’s  Naveen Andrews voices the iconic Khan Noonien Singh while For All Mankind’s Wrenn Schmidt voices his wife, Marla McGivers. Recording has now wrapped (see an exclusive photo of Andrews in the recording booth in the slideshow below).\nAdditional cast will be announced at a later date.\nStar Trek: Khan is based on a story byStar Trek II: The Wrath of Khanwriter and director Nicholas Meyer. Kirsten Beyer and David Mack serve as writers on the series.\nThe official plot synopsis says the audio series “will explore the dramatic untold events that unfolded in the desolate world of Ceti Alpha V after Captain Kirk left Khan and his followers stranded there, paving the way for the iconic clash in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.”\n“History remembersKhan Noonien Singh as a villain, the product of a failed attempt to perfect humanity through genetic engineering whose quest to avenge himself on Admiral James T. Kirk led to unimaginable tragedy and loss. But the truth has been buried for too long beneath the sands of Ceti Alpha V. How did Khan go from a beneficent tyrant and superhuman visionary with a new world at his fingertips to the monster we think we know so well? Recently unearthed, the rest of Khan’s story will finally be told in Star Trek: Khan.”\nAs depicted inthe classic original series episode titled Space Seed, Khan and his genetically engineered disciples were awakened from cryogenic sleep after two centuries only to then try to commandeer the USS Enterprise.\nLt. Marla McGivers was a Starfleet historian who fell in love with Khan and aided him in his attempted takeover. In the end, she opted to follow Khan into exile on Ceti Alpha V rather than face court martial. Those who have seen The Wrath of Khan know McGivers met a grim fate while marooned on Ceti Alpha V.\nStar Trek: Khan is produced by CBS’ Eye Podcast Productions Inc. CBS Studio’s podcasting arm; Secret Hideout; and Roddenberry Entertainment. Executive producers include Alex Kurtzman, Aaron Baiers, Kirsten Beyer, Molly Barton, Fred Greenhalgh, Trevor Roth and Rod Roddenberry.

        "headline": "Daredevil: Cold Day in Hell Gives Matt Murdock the Dark Knight Returns Treatment",
        "body": "It’s certainly a good time to be a Daredevil fan. The live-action Netflix series is finally getting a continuation in the form of Daredevil: Born Again on Disney+. Meanwhile, on the comic book side of things, Marvel is kicking off a new miniseries called Daredevil: Cold Day in Hell. Not only does this series reunite Death of Wolverine creators Charles Soule and Steve McNiven, it’s got a pretty sweet elevator pitch. What if Daredevil got his own version of The Dark Knight Returns?\n\nIGN spoke with Soule and McNiven via email to find out what exactly that means for poor, beleaguered Matt Murdock. First, check out an exclusive preview of Daredevil: Cold Day in Hell #1 in the slideshow gallery below, and then read on to find out more about the series and Soule’s thoughts on his past DD work being adapted in Born Again.\n\nThe Dark Knight returns really is the easiest point of comparison with this series. Rather than being set in the present-day Marvel Universe, Cold Day in Hell takes place at a time when Matt Murdock has lost his powers and is grappling with both old age and the ghosts of his tragedy-prone past. As Soule reveals, Matt is hardly the only hero to hang up his tights in this futuristic Marvel Universe, at least until something coaxes him back into action.\n“Matt's older, for sure,” Soule tells IGN. “We don't get specific with it, but the idea is that he left super hero life behind many years ago. Not just him, either - in the world of Cold Day In Hell, super heroes are long gone, at least in comparison to the way they operate in the present-day Marvel Universe. The reason for Matt leaving Daredevil behind is actually pretty simple, if you're using super hero logic. As we all know, Matt got his powers by being accidentally dosed with radioactive goop. Radioactivity fades with time, and in this story, the idea is that over time Matt's powers faded away too. He's still got all his combat training, but he hasn't used it for a very long time. He is, to put it pretty plainly, an ordinary older man with an extraordinary past that he's worked quite hard to move beyond. At least, that's our status quo as we begin.”\nOf course, The Dark Knight Returns is hardly the only comic to tackle the “aging superhero gets back into action” trope. That premise has fueled plenty of Marvel books as well, from the various The End titles to McNiven and Mark Millar’s Old Man Logan. As Soule explains, there’s a good reason this type of story tends to crop up so often.\n“For me, the tonal switcheroo you get when you show familiar characters at unfamiliar points in their lives can be a really potent way to define them in new ways for readers,” Soule says. “It also lets you define them more clearly. What parts of Matt Murdock persist when his ability to be a super hero in the traditional sense vanishes? He's clearly not Daredevil when we begin - does he need to be? Stories like this give you the best of both worlds - they can let you strip the hero down to their bare essentials while also letting you come up with a lot of fun ideas that are outside the regular continuity in some ways.”\nSoule continues, “Cold Day In Hell takes place in its own corner of the Marvel Universe where terrible things have happened in the somewhat recent past, the after-effects of which resonate through the lives of the characters and the story. So, Steve and I get to make up a bunch of cool new things that use iconic Marvel elements, while also putting our own spin on all of them. That is… what many of these stories do, and of course I think Steve and I were both inspired by other brilliant variations on this theme.”\nMcNiven adds, \"Charles is exactly right, stripping the hero down to their bare essential is what we were going for tonally in this tale. There are a number of great inspirations in and out of the comic world for this kind of treatment that I’m sure we could both list a number of them. But for me, it always starts with Frank Miller's Dark Knight Returns. I’ve always been fascinated with that story, both in tone and in its storytelling techniques. A part of the reason I wanted to tackle this project was to explore Miller’s storytelling devices, particularly the 16 panel grid, where each page can be laid out in variations of 4 vertical panels and 4 horizontal panels. The task was to try and do that consistently throughout the entire story, something I don’t think I’ve seen done too many times over the years.\"\nMcNiven elaborates on how exactly The Dark Knight Returns has inspired Cold Day in Hell visually, calling the book nothing less than a love letter to Frank Miller.\n\"I would say that at its heart this project has been my unabashed love letter to Frank Miller. Frank to me is a pure visual genius and his work has inspired me all the way through this project,\" McNiven says. \"I’m having so much fun exploring his storytelling and line work techniques he has employed, as well as Lynn Varley’s colour work, especially within the Elektra Lives Again graphic novel. I love to learn new things and I think it’s important to learn these lessons from the best of the best. To that end I have co plotted, penciled, and inked the whole thing. Hell, I even coloured the first issue myself before realizing that I just hate working on the computer to colour stuff. Luckily we have the amazing Nick Lowe for our editor at Marvel and he managed to secure the talents of Dean White to colour issue 2 and 3, saving me from going completely mad.\"\nThis isn’t the first time Soule and McNiven have collaborated on a story about a Marvel hero confronting their mortality. That was also the premise behind 2014’s Death of Wolverine, a story that wound up taking the iconic X-Man out of commission for several years. We were curious whether Soule views Cold Day in Hell as a companion piece to Death of Wolverine in any way, even if the two stories are set in very different versions of the Marvel Universe.\n“I think everything we do together is in some ways a companion piece to everything we've done,” Soule says. “I've been truly fortunate to work with Steve as much as I have. From the Wolverine stories, to Uncanny Inhumans, to Star Wars, and now Daredevil, I think everything we've done is an evolution of our ability to work together, and our friendship outside the comics. I have immense trust in Steve's ability to just, you know, do amazing things on the page, and I think he feels the same way about my scripts, hopefully. This book was extremely collaborative in a way that was a bit of an experiment for us, a back and forth discussion as scripts and inks and dialogue and colors came in throughout, and I think people are going to see that on the page. Steve called it ‘jazz’ at one point, and I don't think that's so far off. I'm really proud of all the work I've done with Steve, but this one really stands out.”\n\"This is definitely a story that fits in with all of the other things Charles and I have collaborated on over the years, and is probably the most ambitious,\" McNiven says. \"A unique type of work that could only happen after years of working together and trusting each other’s abilities. It’s an experimental piece in the best sense of the word and although it was fraught with difficulties at the heart of it we were having fun pushing the boundaries of our collaborative efforts. Hopefully it will appear seamless and give readers something enjoyable and engaging to read.\"\nHalf the fun with stories like Cold Day in Hell is seeing how a given hero’s various friends and enemies have fared in old age. For example, The Dark Knight Returns reveals Joker to have become all but catatonic in Batman’s absence, while Superman becomes a puppet of the US government and Green Arrow becomes a one-armed anarchist. Soule is hesitant to reveal much about what role Daredevil’s supporting cast and villains will play in the series, but he did confirm that readers can expect some major surprises on that front.\nSoule teased, “Don't want to say more than that, though - that stuff is part of what I think people are going to tune in for.”\nMNiven adds, \" I do have to take a moment to say that I think Charles has done an astounding job with this story and I truly feel that the final issue has some of the best writing I have ever encountered in my 20 plus years of working in comics. Brilliant stuff and I can’t wait for it to be out on the stands!\"\nGiven the timing of Daredevil: Cold Day in Hell #1’s release, it’s clear Marvel is looking to capitalize on the debut of the Born Again show. We asked Soule whether this series works as an accessible gateway into the Daredevil comics, despite being set in the future and building on decades of existing Daredevil continuity.\nSoule says, “I think so! It's designed as a story people can pick up and enjoy if they know the most basic things about Daredevil and his past - blind, Catholic lawyer who had super-senses and ninja training at one time, but now he doesn't. It probably helps if you know a bit about some of the key adversaries and allies in Matt Murdock's orbit, but you don't have to.”\nOn the subject of Born Again, it’s become clear that the series draws at least some inspiration from Soule’s 2015-2018 run on the series. Like the comic, the show deals with Wilson Fisk becoming mayor of New York City and features the artistically inclined villain Muse. Soule confirmed that the series does draw from his run, including in other ways fans may not be expecting.\nI've been fortunate enough to see the entire season of Daredevil: Born Again, and can confirm that the work I did with Ron Garney and my other amazing collaborators during my Daredevil run in the comics is all over the show,” Soule says. “Mayor Fisk and Muse, yep, but other elements too, particularly just the thematic things we were playing with back in 2015-2018. As far as how it felt? It felt amazing. The thought that these ideas will be reaching that many people, when I can still remember writing them down in my red Daredevil notebook almost a decade ago now as things that might be cool... what a wonderful thing. I think fans will really enjoy the show.”\nDaredevil: Cold Day in Hell #1 will be released on April 2, 2025.\nFor more on what’s coming from Marvel Comics, check outwhat to expect from Marvel in 2025and seeour most anticipated comics of 2025.\nJesse is a mild-mannered staff writer for IGN.

        "headline": "The Andor Season 2 Trailer Promises the Return of a Major Villain… and She’s a Mom",
        "body": "There’s a lot going on in the minute and 35 seconds of theAndorSeason 2 trailer that dropped this week, with characters from the first season and new faces alike popping up, stormtroopers blasting away, explosions, spaceships, and onscreen accolades from critics, all set to the tune of Steve Earle’s folk-rock song “The Revolution Starts Now.” But themost exciting moment in the traileris when Syril Karn’s mother shows up. She’s in just one shot for barely a second, but oh boy, is that henpecking, guilt-laying, banality-of-evil-inspiring mama back. And man, did I miss her.\n\nIn case you need a quick refresher on Mother Karn – her full name is Eedy Karn and she’s played by Kathryn Hunter – we first met her in “Aldhani,” the fourth episode of Season 1. After Syril (Kyle Soller) had washed out of his job doing security for the Preox-Morlana Corporation, he returned home to Coruscant, disgraced, to… move back in with his mom. Is his room in her basement? Has he ever touched a girl? Hard to say.\nNext episode, as she’s pouring cereal and blue milk for him, Eedy says to her son, “Syril, you're slouching. Is that how you've been presenting yourself to the world?” And then, “You might as well wear a sign that says, ‘I promise to disappoint you.’” Yeah, she’s one ofthoseparents.\nAll in all, the relationship between the two continues this way every time we see her in Season 1 – it’s all very strained, awful even. Syril seems to have no affection for his mother, and really, Eedy seems to feel the same way. And there’s no need for promises, because Eedy isalreadydisappointed in Syril. While working on Season 1, Soller and Hunter agreed upon a backstory on how their characters wound up in the emotionally-stunted place that they’re in, and it can be traced back to Syril’s father.\n“We had kind of figured out the same thing, that he had left really early on, in a real acrimonious, horrible way,”Soller told SlashFilmin 2022. “That was a real launchpad for how Eedy then parents Syril, which is by being wronged. And her anger, and grief, and disappointment, and frustration of him leaving just got filtered into Syril. Growing up without a father is … that absence definitely drives Syril as much as the over-dominating maternal influence.”\nThe thing about Eedy, and Syril, is that they are just examples of the messed-up, damaged, but actually incredibly pedestrian family- and interpersonal-dynamics in the show that contribute on the ground level, and then up the chain, to the Empire being, well, the Empire. Syril wants nothing more than to serve and be recognized for that service, no matter if what he’s doing is truly right or wrong. Mon Mothma’s (Genevieve O'Reilly) husband Perrin (Alastair Mackenzie) is a carousing do-nothing who doesn’t mind hanging out with awful people as long as the champagne… uh, Chandrilan Squig is good. The Rebel Arvel Skeen (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) and his sob story about his dead brother turns out to be a bunch of malarkey, as Arvel’s rebellion is actually him against everyone else, as he says, and all he really wants is the money he and Andor helped steal on Aldhani. And so on.\nWhat Andor winds up being about is simply the story of how regular people can choose, if you’ll forgive the term, the light side or the dark side. And sometimes they don’t even know they’re making that choice. For every Arvel who doesn’t care about the bigger world, there’s an Eedy Karn. Surely Eedy (who is wonderfully realized in Kathryn Hunter’s performance in what is really just a handful of scenes throughout the first season) thinks she’s doing the best for her son, even as she helps to mold and warp him into his full form as the perfect Imperial lackey.\n“I knew they’d recognize your promise,” she beams near the end of the season when she hears Syril’s gotten a promotion. He’s going places, you know.",

        "headline": "Running Point Review",
        "body": "If there's one arena where Kate Hudson is an undisputed all-star, it's the comedy genre, and the new Netflix series Running Point certainly provides the court for the actor to perform her charm offense. Yet it's somewhat wasted in a series attempting to blend the idealistic gusto ofTed Lassowith the witty familial tensions ofSuccession, while doing justice to neither.\n\nRunning Point takes place in the hypercompetitive world of professional basketball, where Hudson's tough-but-messy female protagonist Isla Gordon is thrust into the role of president for the LA Waves, \"the greatest basketball franchise in the history of the game\" and a business her family has run for decades. With the support of Ali (Brenda Strong), her sassy best friend and chief of staff, she has to prove herself in the sexist world of men's sports and break that glass ceiling for extremely rich, reformed party girls everywhere – an overly sympathetic depiction of a difficult-to-relate-to character type that rarely offers any meaningful commentary on the wealth and comfort Isla otherwise lives in.\nFrom the get-go, Hudson's narration and flashbacks to a childhood of being overlooked by her formidable (and long deceased) father make it very clear that she's an expert on the game. But as she tries to secure team sponsorships and broadcast deals, rally players and turn the Waves’ losing season around, her expertise and decision-making are constantly questioned and disrespected This is mostly because she's a glamorous girl who likes to wear unbuttoned blouses and keeps banging into glass doors – a running gag that quickly wears out its welcome.\nAs with Succession, Isla is the only daughter among her father’s children – but unlike that modern HBO classic, each of those brothers suffers from stock character syndrome. Ness (Scott MacArthur), a player-turned-Waves general manager, is a sweet but idiotic dude bro. Sandy (Drew Tarver) is her uptight, gay half-brother and the Waves’ chief financial officer. Cam (Justin Theroux) is the Type A eldest brother whose secret drug addiction lands him in trouble in the first episode, freeing up the Waves presidency for him to offer Isla – just so she can keep his office warm while he's in rehab.\nThen there's affable and naive Jackie (Fabrizio Guido), who starts out selling concessions for the Waves before learning he has a more personal connection to the team: His late mother had an affair with Papa Gordon, who was Jackie’s biological father. Jackie’s scenes dangle awkwardly off the first couple of episodes, and then he spends the rest of the season trying to connect with the dysfunctional family he never knew he had. Ultimately, he serves as a tool to humanize these self-involved assholes, especially towards the tail end of the season when Ness, Sandy, and Isla let the sibling rivalry go and begin opening up to each other about each of their half-baked romantic subplots.\nOf course, it couldn't be a series about a woman leaning in without a personal cost, and from the minute Isla's pediatrician fiance Lev Levinson (Max Greenfield) is introduced, the sign-posting that they aren’t built to go the distance is egregious. Like the Gordons, Lev's characterization is thin – he’s generically nice, Jewish, and little else – while Greenfield and Hudson's chemistry is so tepid that it's a real struggle to ever invest in their relationship. Especially with how often the camera lusts over the Waves’ divorced head coach, Jay Brown (Jay Ellis), who’s thrown in as a hot, zen romantic rival to Lev. Ellis and Hudson certainly generate more heat, but Running Point never establishes a more intimate connection that might explain their attraction. As a result, this workplace romance comes off as trite.\nTheroux’s screentime is limited, but his blunt delivery and cut-throat attitude make him the MVP of Running Point. He sharpens the comedy notes as Cam tries to undermine Isla and secure his release from rehab. Theroux earns extra laughs with his curt requests for drugs and attempts to fast-track his recovery; unfortunately, the writers are so desperate to make the other Gordons likeable that they pull their punches. There are some amusing slapstick scenes – namely involving Ness' moronic behavior and comments towards his siblings and wife – but the show rarely provides the type of biting dialogue that could puncture the family’s arrogance or entitlement.\nAnd for a show that makes a song and dance about its female lead being an authority on basketball, Running Point really shortcuts how Isla manages to take the Waves from zeroes to heroes. Instead, the writers offer undercooked subplots about a redneck player with a painkiller addiction, a rookie struggling to score free throws, and a stoic star stepping up to lead. It does, however, outdo Ted Lasso when it comes to shooting some of its game sequences – which, considering the soccer action on that Apple TV+ comedy, is admittedly a low bar. Still, there are pick-up games on TikTok that offer more athletic thrills than Running Point.\nRunning Point has its charm, and Kate Hudson proves she still has some leading lady chops. But its stock characters and superficial storylines amount to a tepid first season that doesn't have the narrative depth nor comedic tenacity to engage and unpack the high-stakes subject of running a professional basketball franchise. Nor does it get under the skin of its elite characters, choosing placid likeability over weighty class commentary to its detriment.",

        "headline": "Best TCG Storage Boxes and Binders: Top Picks for MTG and Pokémon Collectors",
        "body": "Not all cards are meant to be played with. If you’re into collectibles already or just starting to collect trading cards, you may have a big enough collection that warrants some extra care or bulk storage. Some of your cards may even have significant value or will continue to grow in value, depending on what cards you collect and how you store them. As an investment, many serious collectors go to significant lengths to protect their cards such as sleeving or even double-sleeving them. However, even if your cards aren’t worth much monetarily, they are still nostalgic and special to you; whether it bePokémon TCG, Yu-Gi-Oh, sports cards,MTG cards(shoutout thenew Final Fantasy collection), X-Men cards, or others. That said, you should consider the right dedicated storage option for your type of collection and your budget.\n\nFortunately, just like withvideo game storage, there are all sorts of carefully crafted containers you can use to protect your trading cards these days. If you’re just getting into collecting now, starting to collect more, or you simply want to upgrade your storage option from the old ring binder you’ve been using since the 1990s, this (unranked) list is for you.\nWhile some focus on security above all else, many others are stylish and portable too, making it easy and fun to tote your cards out and about. For all of you card collectors, see our picks below of the best trading card storage options for every situation, collection size and budget. Happy collecting!\nQuiver cases are almost universally adored in the card gaming community, and it’s easy to see why. Whatever your storage needs, it’s quite possible a single quiver case will fit the bill. It’s big enough to hold over a thousand unsleeved cards, yet it’s also sturdy and portable, coming with wrist and shoulder carrying straps, a tough shell with a water-resistant faux-leather finish and a secure zip closure. So it’s just as useful whether you’re storing cards in the home or carrying them out to play.\nPerhaps the best thing about Quiver Time, though, is the stylish design and attention to detail. They come in a variety of colors to suit your preference and have all sorts of thoughtful little extras. There’s a sheath to keep the zip tabs closed, fully adjustable straps, some card sleeves and removable acrylic dividers and corner cushions to help keep your cards organized. And perhaps most thoughtful of all, 1% of the asking price goes to charity.\nIf you’ve got a bigger collection of cards and want a solid and well-designed stackable box to keep them in, then look no further. Each GameGenic Dungeon can hold a thousand double-sleeved cards, or a few more if you’re happy to box them up “naked”. There’s a middle divider to keep them better organized and make it easier to search through your collection when you need to.\nThe lid goes on via a convenient magnetic mechanism which makes it simple to pop on and off but holds strongly and securely when not in use. It also allows for complete removal, making it simple to access all your cards. There’s room above the cards to keep a game board, rules or accessories, and it’s a stylish solution with a smooth exterior and a soft microfibre lining to cushion your cards.\nWhile Quivers are fantastic all-round cases, they’re a little on the bulky side if you carry your cards around a lot. If you’re just after a case to take out to clubs and tournaments then they make a smaller option, the Bolt, for that very purpose. It holds a little more than half the capacity of its bigger sibling, but that also means it has half the weight and size.\nIn all other respects, it offers the same high quality build and styling of the Quiver, meaning your cards are just as well-packed and protected, only on a smaller scale. And you still get a free pack of card sleeves and 1% of the price to a children's orphan-based charity as well.\nBoxes are not always the best option for storing your cards, not least because it’s difficult to flip through your collection and find the cards you need. Binders make a great alternative: although they hold fewer cards, they fit nicely onto shelves or cupboards and most options contain transparent pages with pockets into which to tuck your cards.\nThis binder from VaultX not only contains 20 such pages that hold 9 cards each, but boasts a protective padded cover and heavy-duty zip to keep your cards safe and secure. The standard version is standard black, but it comes in a variety of colors, sizes, and closures, so you can be sure to find one that fits your needs.\nDepending on how valuable your cards are and where you take them, you might feel the need to have a super-secure option to keep them safe. And they don’t come much safer than this Casematix case, with extra-durable hard shell exterior and customisable foam inserts that you can tear to ensure a perfect fit for your most prized cards.\nThe case closes with a secure mechanism that also ensures its waterproof and airtight for maximum protection. And if that’s not enough for you, it’s designed to take cards in their own protective plastic slabs and there’s also a padlock ring so you can lock things down even tighter with added layers of your own security.\nOften, it’s fine to keep your cards in whatever container or case you can rustle up at home, but what you really want is a small, sturdy, premium-build box that you can use when taking a single deck of your precious cards out and about to play. Many brands have starter packs that come with suitable deck boxes for free, but they’re often flimsy cardboard affairs, so it’s better to invest in something a bit more durable.\nEnter this excellent option from VaultX. It’s available in a variety of stylish single-color finished, made of water-resistant microfibre. The lid doesn’t clip or slide on and off, as is common, but is held in place with strong magnets, making opening and closing super convenient. And the lid also flips round and magnetizes to the bottom of the box, tidying it out of the way and offering a stable platform to access your cards. You can also mix and match lids and boxes of different colors if so desired.\nFor all the fancy protective cases you can buy for trading cards, fundamentally all you actually need for them is a box of some kind. And a box can be as basic as a piece of packaging that came with some other order: four sides and a lid will keep your cards in order just as well as a golden chest. There’s no need to spend a fortune if you don’t want the style and features offered by premium brands.\nBut that doesn’t mean there’s not something to be gained by spending at least a little on a storage option. Rather than a discarded cardboard box, you could get a specialized option like this. It’s sized just right to protect trading cards, comes with some dividers to keep things organized and has a top-loading lid so it’s easy to peruse your cards. Multiples will also stack neatly on your shelves to keep your cards together.\nAnyone who has been a collector over the years knows binders may be the easiest and most convenient way to store cards, but can harm the cards over time. So, if you have any high-value cards or potentially high-value cards, it’s recommended to store them in sleeves or penny sleeves and put them in top loaders or boxes versus binders.\nDepending on your budget, size of your collection, and value of your cards, you can start with a convenient option like a D-Ring binder, and work your way up from there. Based on the categories listed in the product options above, we're confident you'll find something affordable to get you started. What you choose will be based on many factors. For example, you may collect or play with Pokémon TCG cards and you just want to turn a stack of cards into an organized storage solution like using a cute, simplePokémon card binder.\nTip: look for 'Acid-Free' and 'Soft-Backed' in the descriptions while shopping around. Also, consider your preference on matte versus glossy pocket pages. According to a recentReddit pollon the subject, the majority of votes landed on glossy sleeves based on pros and cons of visibility, shuffling, quality and texture.\nAccording to Guinness World Records, the title of 'world's rarest trading card' is tied between the 1996 World Champion and MTG's Shichifukujin Dragon cards, in which only one specimen of each card exists.\nDID YOU KNOW?\nIf you’re a collector or gamer in organization mode currently (it seems like you might be!), you may want to browse our other storage and display guides. We'd recommended checking out topvideo game storage ideas, topboard game storage options, bestcases to display LEGOs, and the bestdisplay cases for action figures.

        "body": "Oscar-winning actor Gene Hackman, his wife and classical pianist Betsy Arakawa, and their dog were found dead in their Santa Fe, New Mexico home yesterday, February 27, 2025.\nDetails on the passing of Hackman, 95, and Arakawa, 63, come from local authorities, who say that no foul play is suspected (viaAP). They were discovered during a welfare check that took place at 1:45 p.m., according to Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Denise Avila. No cause of death has been revealed at the time of publication.\nUpdate 9:27 a.m. PT:A follow upreport from Varietyreveals that the deaths of Hackman and Arakawa have been ruled \"suspicious enough in nature to require a thorough search and investigation\" according to a search warrant affadavit. The warrant goes on to list a number of details leading to that ruling, including multiple healthy dogs on the property in addition to the deceased dog, the front door being unlocked and open, the heater being moved, pills scattered on the floor next to Arakawa, and no obvious signs of a gas leak.\nOriginal story continues:\n“We can confirm that both Gene Hackman and his wife were found deceased Wednesday afternoon at their residence on Sunset Trail,” a statement sent toBBCfrom the Santa Fe County Sheriff said. “This is an active investigation - however, at this time we do not believe that foul play was a factor.”\nHackman’s career in film began in the 1960s, but he is probably best known for his role as the original live-action Lex Luthor in three of the Christopher Reeve-led Superman movies. The four-film series premiered throughout the late ‘70s and into the late ‘80s, serving as a template for the many comic book movies that would eventually follow in the last two decades.\nHackman’s time on screens big and small extended far beyond the world of comic books, too. The legendary actor’s credits can be traced back to TV series like The Defenders and Brenner. In 1971, he starred in William Friedkin’s The French Connection as Jimmy Doyle, a role that went on to win him an Oscar for Best Actor atthe 44th Academy Awards. His second Oscar win – this time for Best Actor in a Supporting role in 1992’s Unforgiven – arrived atthe 65th Academy Awards. Hackman retired from film in the mid-2000s.\nFans of Hackman’s work have already taken to social media to share condolences and remember him for the talent he brought to the movie world. Highlights include clips from some of his most memorable scenes as audiences celebrate his impact on actors and filmmakers everywhere.\nGene Hackman’s about as good as it gets, a legend. Could be playful, menacing, could still be so vulnerable under his gruff exterior and he never ever seemed like he was acting, a total natural. Incredible face, incredible hairline, they don’t create stars like him anymore. RIP\nWe have lost one of the true giants of the screen. Gene Hackman could play anyone, and you could feel a whole life behind it. He could be everyone and no one, a towering presence or an everyday Joe. That’s how powerful an actor he was.

Up until now, the studio best known for movies like Midsommar, Hereditary, Uncut Gems, and Civil War has released a distinctly grown-up slate of features.\n\nNow, A24 aims to be everything, everywhere, all at once is trying something new. Enter: The Legend of Ochi, the studio’s first-ever (with all due respect to Marcel the Shell With Shoes On) movie geared toward families. The film tells the story of a teenage farm girl named Yuri (Helena Zengel) who encounters a juvenile ochi – a mythical and feared creature – and embarks on a quest to return it home.\nZengel, along with the film’s director Isaiah Saxon and co-star Finn Wolfhard, stopped by IGN Fan Fest 2025 to debut a new poster for the movie and tell us about stepping into the rich and imaginative world of Carpathia.\n“We're looking at Helena Zengel with a baby ochi bursting from her chest, which is not an ode to Alien, but is more just a cute design,” Saxon jokes. “Around her, we're seeing her parents, Willem Dafoe and Emily Watson, (and) her somewhat adopted older brother figure in Finn Wolfhard directly above.”\n“And surrounding all of them is this gang of boys that are the local village children who've been indoctrinated and trained by her father to keep the village safe.”\nThe local village, set on the fictional island of Carpathia, is imbued with an immersive sense of wonder and nostalgia, not unlike classic fantasy-adventure movies from the 1980s. Wolfhard didn’t specifically seek that out when agreeing to make The Legend of Ochi, but its place in his career trajectory (which includes 80s-set Stranger Things and the newest entries in the Ghostbusters franchise) isn’t lost on him.\n“For me it's a coincidence. I've been really lucky to just read a bunch of awesome scripts and be able to do the films that I'm interested in,\" Wolfhard explained. \"And Ochi was so intoxicating. There has definitely been a theme of adventure movies that I've been in just because I grew up watching those movies and they're some of my favorites ever.  So I was lucky enough to be a part of another great one.”\nAnd while Saxon says he may have drawn a tiny bit of inspiration from some classic IPs, his goal was to create something entirely new.\n“Peope will say that it’s ‘Baby Yoda meets Goonies.’ But I think if you're a filmmaker and you're just cobbling together elements, it won't have an inner life to it. The work will be dead. And so when I set out to make Ochi, I was just trying to make the story I wanted to see.  And then you might do some research if you get stuck but you're not taking elements off a shelf. You're just trying to have it be born up from your soul if you can,\" Saxon says.\nCentral to the movie is the ochi itself, and Saxon and the crew labored to use animatronics and practical effects to bring the creature to life. In fact, Zengel, who actually rescued an injured dog while filming the movie, became so enraptured with the ochi that the crew had a hard time separating them.\n“It was amazing, because when I first read the script, I wasn't sure if they were going to create an ochi,” Zengel says. “I know a lot of colleagues who have done movies like this and who have not had the chance to have an actual co-star.  (The ochi) became my friend. And then they always had to pull me away from it because I would run off or I would want to go in the water with him.\"\nSaxon says that type of reaction is something he hopes audiences share when the movie opens.\n“The goal of the design from the beginning was to create a plausible-feeling animal species,\" Saxon says. \"Not a mythic movie creature, but something that audiences and particularly kids could misunderstand as just an animal they hadn't learned about. That’s also what guided the creation of the island of Carpathia; that it's also a place that you can maybe think, ‘Hey have I just not learned about it yet?’”\nThe fictional setting was something Wolfhard found inspiring when filming on location in Romania.\n“I knew that it was a big, expansive world from the script and the pitch video that Isaiah made. So much of the wonder was already kind of built in because of the baseline locations (where) we were filming. Isaiah had everything so meticulously planned out, so there was no question what world we were going to be living in once we got to the location,\" Wolfhard says.\nIn addition to a first look at the new movie poster, the team from The Legend of Ochi is exclusively debuting pages from a special “In Search of the Ochi Field Guide” inspired by the film,and available for purchase on the A24 website,as part of IGN Fan Fest.\n\n\"The field guide is so awesome because it almost tricks the audience into believing that the world is more lived in and that it could be a real place,” Wolfhard says. “Carpathia could be a real place, but hasn't been discovered yet or hasn't been talked about yet. It also gives a little bit of interaction (to) the audience, which is always really fun.”\nFor her part, Zengel says that, while she has a copy of the field guide now, she didn’t have one on set to help prepare to enter the world of the ochi.\n“I (only had) very ugly pictures of the ochi without fur on it. I was like, ‘My god, that's going to be my co-star?’ But it looked kind of cute eventually.”\nAs the movie prepares to hit theaters this spring, Saxon hopes The Legend of the Ochi’s central message resonates with audiences of all ages.\n“It’s really important to let your instincts move you and to take action. I hope Ochi can move through people (in a way) that they become less intellectual, more musical and more curious and aware of the intelligence in nature all around us.”",

        "body": "Shrek 5, coming to theatres this December, will feature a returning cast of Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz, Eddie Murphy, as well as a new character with a new voice: Zendaya, playing Shrek and Fiona's daughter.\n\nThis news was announced in aclip from Universal Pictures today, which also gave us our first look at Zendaya's character, who appears to be a teenage ogre like her parents with Fiona's red hair and Shrek's eyes.\nShrek 5 has been in the works for a long time, first whispered aboutway back in 2016when Austin powers writer Michael McCullers said he was writing the story. At the time,it was planned for a 2019 release, but it went quiet for several years before reemerging in 2023 with Illumination CEO Chris Meledandrisaying he wanted to bring back the original cast. Last year, we received confirmation that Eddie Murphy was indeed attached to the project, as well as asolo Donkey spinoff that's still in the works.\nShrek 5 eventuallyreceived a July 2026 release date, but it has since beenpushed to Christmas that same year.\nWe'll have to hope that when Shrek 5 finally arrives it's an improvement on Shrek 4,which we gave a 5/10, saying it felt \"like a compromise in the end\" and that the series, like Shrek himself, must \"learn to come to terms with his new, perhaps less exciting life.\"\nRebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

        "headline": "Last Breath Review",
        "body": "Last Breath opens in theaters Friday, February 28.\n\nI love watching movies about terrible jobs. Anything that involves watching people do impossible, dangerous, potentially deadly tasks to earn their living is good entertainment in my book, especially when I get to watch the proceedings while nestled inside a movie theater recliner or under a blanket on my couch, peeping through my fingers. Amazing news for anyone who shares the same sentiment: Last Breath, the thriller where Woody Harrelson tries to save a guy who is freezing and suffocating to death at the bottom of the ocean, is about what I would consider the worst job in the whole world.\nPart of the fun of watching a movie like Last Breath (and, despite its subject matter, it’s still pretty fun) is in seeing how a filmmaker depicts everything that goes into preparing for an extremely complex and perhaps even dangerous job. In this case, it’s deep-sea saturation diving, which, going into Last Breath, I knew very little about – and, now that I’ve seen it, I feel like I’m an expert. The actors bandy about sci-fi-esque terminology like “heliox” and “umbilical tether” while sealing each other inside metal tubes where their insides will be pressurized according to the atmospheres they’ll be working under at depth. It’s an utterly fascinating process, and a relatively easy way to make sure your audience is locked in for whatever happens next.\nIt also has the added benefit of being about something that actually happened not that long ago: a real-life accident in which diver Chris Lemons’ connections to air, heat, and communications systems onboard his support vessel were severed, marooning him at the bottom of the North Sea with only a small backup supply of oxygen. His fellow divers Duncan Allcock and David Yuasa embarked on a daring mission to get Lemons back to the surface, not knowing if it would be a rescue or a body recovery.\nLast Breath plays things by the book, a typically tense survival drama with all the terrifying missteps and inspiring moments of human endurance that go with it. The trio of leads is a study in stock character types: Lemons (Finn Cole) is the youthful newbie determined to prove himself to the pros. Allcock (Harrelson) is the paternal veteran trying to get the most out of his last assignment before retirement. Yuasa (Simu Liu) carries himself with the zen-like intensity one could expect from someone whose day job is trying not to die at the bottom of the ocean. It’s savvy to keep things feeling this familiar, given the wild reality Last Breath dramatizes.\nAnd, boy, is it wild. We get a front-row seat to the inner workings of saturation diving: Actors are constantly yanking heavy diving suits on and off, and a large portion of the action was filmed underwater. Scenes aboard the support vessel’s bridge (captained by Cliff Curtis – I always love seeing him) are bookended by vertigo-inducing shots of the prow plunging into troughs between 50-foot swells. Director Alex Parkinson reuses some of the real footage he gathered for the 2019 documentary he made about the accident (also called Last Breath, and co-directed by Richard da Costa), including one truly awful shot of an unconscious Lemons going into oxygen deprivation shock. There are times when what’s onscreen feels overwhelming, and then you remember that all of this genuinely happened. That knowledge adds a real sense of awe that a completely made-up story just wouldn’t be able to conjure.\nLast Breathmainly succeeds because of what it’s about. The actors are capable, the script keeps things simple, and the direction from Parkinson is very good (props to the underwater filming crew). That’s really all it takes for a movie like this – my only real gripe is that the archetypal anxious girlfriend character (Bobby Rainsbury) is little more than that, a character type that’s more frustrating for how ubiquitous it is in this sort of movie. I was just happy to be watching a bunch of people running around on the ocean floor trying not to freeze to death  And I was even happier not to be down there with them.\nLast Breath is just as wild and tense as you’d expect from a movie starring Woody Harrelson, Finn Cole, and Simu Liu as saturation divers determined to risk their lives after one of their own becomes marooned at the bottom of the ocean. A capably directed true-story disaster movie with a cast willing to squeeze themselves inside deep-sea diving suits, it’s helped by the knowledge that everything you’re seeing actually happened, and the inherent fascination from watching people work terrible, impossible jobs. In spite of all of its nail-biting close calls and harrowing footage from the actual rescue, it’s actually a lot of fun.",

        "body": "I've read all of theHarry Potter booksmultiple times over and they are always just as good as I remember, even after all these years. However, it is always fun to experience the story in a new way. TheHarry Potter moviesare one way to do that, but the illustrated editions of the books are arguably more enticing. Although the series has yet to receive a complete set of illustrated books, there is a new interactive edition of the Goblet of Fire arriving in October that you can preorder right now.\n\nNot to be confused with thebooks illustrated by Jim Kay, the interactive editions of Harry Potter feature wonderful illustrations as well as paper-engineered elements that pop off the page. You can currently preorder the new book at Barnes & Noble and Amazon, both discounted by 20%.\nThis illustrated edition features 150 full-color illustrations and elements similar to a pop-up book. The new book is illustrated by Karl James Mountford and the papercraft designs were made by Jess Tice-Gilbert. This is a different group of creatives that worked on this book after the previous interactive illustrated editions from MinaLimawere discontinuedafter The Prisoner of Azkaban. Although the illustrations and interactive elements in this book won't be the same, it is good news for collectors who were hoping to finish adding all of these editions to their shelves.\nThe other Harry Potter books that were illustrated by Jim Kay currently only run through book five. In 2022,Kay stepped downfrom the project, so it is unclear if and when we will get versions for The Half Blood Prince and The Deathly Hallows. That being said, there isstill some hopethat the series will be finished by a new illustrator.\nLooking for more like this?

        "body": "Followingthe shock news that Amazon has taken full creative control over James Bond, with long-term 007 producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson stepping back, a new report has shed light on the next steps from the franchise — and a surprising revelation about one high-profile director who was snubbed.\n\nAmid speculation that Amazon may decide to go with a Bond TV series,Varietyreported that a new Bond film is still the “top priority.” As for what’s next, Amazon will allegedly first look for a producer for the franchise. Apparently David Heyman, who shepherded the Harry Potter and Fantastic Beasts films with a cohesive vision, is the kind of producer Amazon is looking for.\nMeanwhile, the report alleges that Christopher Nolan “expressed interest” in directing a Bond movie afterTenet, but Broccoli insisted no director would have “final cut” while she was in charge of the franchise and turned him down. Nolan went on to makeOppenheimer, which made nearly $1 billion at the global box office and won the best picture and best director (Nolan) Oscars.\nFans are particularly keen to know who will play Bond next. While some are calling for the likes of Venom star Tom Hardy, the MCU's Idris Elba, Professor X actor James McAvoy, Magneto actor Michael Fassbender, and Kraven’s Aaron Taylor-Johnson (who was previously rumored to be top of the list) to be given the role,the clear fan-favorite is Superman and The Witcher star Henry Cavill.\nAccording to Variety, Amazon is unable to hire anyone on Bond until the closure of its Broccoli-Wilson deal, which is expected at some point this year. The news followed an explosive report that alleged the future of the James Bond franchise was “on pause” amid what was described as an “ugly” stalemate between the Broccoli family and Amazon.\nThe behind-the-scenes battle between Barbara Broccoli, who had retained creative control over Bond and decided who played the iconic British spy, and Amazon, which acquired the right to release Bond movies afterit bought Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in a deal worth $8.45 billion back in 2021, had left Bond “trapped,” theWall Street Journalreported.\nAmazon and Eon have yet to issue a comment.\nPhoto by Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic.\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

        "headline": "I Heart Willie Review",
        "body": "If you’re shocked and appalled by the notion of a slasher movie headlined by a Mickey Mouse lookalike, you must have missedWinnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey(parts 1and2),The Mean One, andPeter Pan’s Neverland Nightmare. We’re living through a flood of rushed-to-the-screen horror made possible by the public domain, parody law, and the fluke success of Rhys Frake-Waterfield’s buzzworthy “Poohniverse” (a.k.a. Twisted Childhood Universe), and it’s finally come for Walt Disney’s most famous creation. Unfortunately, director Alejandro G. Alegre’s I Heart Willie has less to offer than some of the blunders mentioned above: Its reimagining of Mickey’s Steamboat Willie persona (the first version of the character to lose its copyright protection) is overthought, undercooked, and not in the business of payoffs. It’s an exploitation of our familiarity with Mickey Mouse and little else.\n\nWilliam “Willie” Cross (David Vaughn, who also wrote and produced I Heart Willie) is a deformed German man rumored to be half mouse, half human, and the supposed inspiration for Disney’s pioneering effort in sound cartoons. He’s your typical slasher villain with a tragic history – a local legend with a habit of skinning trespassers – distinguished by the fact that he dresses like a paddle-steamer-piloting rodent. When a quartet of ghost hunting vloggers chooses Willie’s turf for their next episode, I Heart Willie flimsily sets up cheap flesh-flaying thrills that never stray far from convention.\nVaughn’s story mixes up a confusing cocktail ofNatural Born KillersandNosferatu, garnished withHostel-style mutilation. Once paranormal investigator Nora (Maya Luna) confesses that she has a romantic connection with Willie, it’s clear that her colleagues are done for. She’s pulled toward Willie like an obsessed fan; they’re bonded by a past encounter, but this shared backstory lacks the clarity that’d smooth over the bumpiness with which it’s revealed. Similarly unpolished: Willie is a mouse boy who doesn’t look all that mousey. Aside from his milky eyes, it’s the gruesome burn scars that define the character’s design. His affinity for Steamboat Willie and cut-rate cosplay – black leg paint, ugly gloves, grimy white shorts, and flimsy mask – link I Heart Willie with its animated inspiration, but they’re hardly the makings of a murderous romantic lead.\nThis is a shambling production: The lighting levels are inconsistently balanced, causing twitchy auto-focus adjustments while the cast drone on and on. The editing is reckless and abrupt, cutting awkwardly away from the violent onscreen action and plowing any momentum I Heart Willie might have into a brick wall. The sound occasionally bottoms out, and the hum of background static sometimes downs out the dialogue.\nWhereas Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey 2 strives to fulfill its audience’s expectations for extreme kills and memorable grossness, Alegre can only push so far. While we see Willie scalping his victims and carving away bits of their flesh, anything beyond that happens off-camera. A dismemberment, a joint stabbing, and other heinous acts are portrayed only through sound design and the spurts of blood that make Willie’s getup black and white and red all over.\nI Heart Willie masquerades as a traumatizing tale of fated lovers, but remove its mask and you’ll find no real personality beneath. This is neither the first nor the last horror movie to be inspired by Steamboat Willie, but it doesn’t do much to stand out from competition that includesDavid Howard Thorton trading Art the Clown’s tiny little hat for a pair of mouse ears aboard the decommissioned ferry owned by Colin Jost and Pete Davidson. (Nowthat’s an unexpected combination of recognizable pop-culture icons.) Instead, I Heart Willie fades into the background, unable to do anything more than scribble some blood and guts in the margins of Disney’s blueprint.\nI Heart Willie is a public domain slasher with little to offer beyond its absurd reimagining of the animated short that introduced Mickey and Minnie Mouse to the world. The fun of dropping their love story into a horror movie is lost to an amateur execution that wastes a few morsels of gooey gore. It takes all the wrong lessons from Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey and its successors/imitators, believing “Mickey Gone Mad” is enough.",

        "body": "The rap mogul is facing down more than two dozen civil lawsuits accusing him of sexual assault and misconduct\nWireImage\nA former escort claims that Sean “Diddy” Combs anally raped him and then threatened to do to him what he did to “Pac,” a new lawsuit alleges.\nThe lawsuit was filed in federal court in New York on Wednesday, Feb. 26 on behalf of an anonymous man, who accuses Combs, 55, of drugging and anally raping him and then threatening him to stay quiet about the incident.\nPer the complaint, the alleged victim, then 31, met Combs through a male companion service in Florida where he worked as a contractor and would travel from Florida to New York City “at Combs’ request.”\nThe unnamed accuser alleged he travelled to New York City in 2012 and met Combs at the Intercontinental Hotel where he was “brought into a suite where Combs soon ordered Doe to perform sexual acts upon a female companion of Combs.’”\nPer the complaint, Combs allegedly had the man drink from a water bottle and then rubbed baby oil over his body, “one or both of which made Doe feel as if he had been drugged and not in complete control of his body.”\nHe was then told to have sex with Combs’ companion for “multiple hours, degrading her and directing Doe to degrade and perform degrading acts upon her.”\nThe man claimed that he was later in the bathroom when Combs approached him, saying, “I really want you to stay, let’s turn up, let’s turn up.”\nWant to keep up with the latest crime coverage? Sign up forPEOPLE's free True Crime newsletterfor breaking crime news, ongoing trial coverage and details of intriguing unsolved cases.\nWhen the man refused because he wasn’t feeling well, Combs grabbed his penis, inserted his finger in the man's rectum before \"forcibly\" anally raping him.\n“Doe continually told Combs to stop, screaming ‘no’ because he was in pain,” the complaint alleges.\nThe complaint further alleges that after the alleged assault, Combs “began to threaten him\" to keep quiet.\n“I’m not f***ing playing with you,\" Combs allegedly told Doe. \"If I can get Pac [presumably referring to Tupac Shakur, who was gunned down in Las Vegas in 1996] hit, what the f*** do you think can happen to you?”\nDoe, fearing for his life, again affirmed that he would not say anything about the assault.”\nDozens of lawsuits have been filed against the rap mogul accusing him ofsexual misconduct. He has repeatedly denied he did anything wrong.\n“No matter how many lawsuits are filed—especially by individuals who refuse to put their own names behind their claims—it won’t change the fact that Mr. Combs has never sexually assaulted or sex trafficked anyone—man or woman, adult or minor,\" his lawyers wrote in a statement. \"We live in a world where anyone can file a lawsuit for any reason. Fortunately, a fair and impartial judicial process exists to find the truth, and Mr. Combs is confident he will prevail in court.”\nIn addition, Combs is facing multiple federal criminal charges, including sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. He has pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges.\nCombs is in custody at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. His trial is scheduled for May.\nIf you or someone you know has been sexually assaulted, please contact the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 1-800-656-HOPE (4673) or go torainn.org.",

        "body": "The show's host said the premiere was \"so packed that our very first cut was very long\" and the injury's aftermath didn't make the cut\nRobert Voets/CBS (2)\nSurvivorseason 48 got off to a bit of a rocky start, but viewers at home were none the wiser.\nDuring filming for the premiere, which aired on Feb. 26, production hit a snag as Kevin Leung injured his shoulder during the marooning challenge. The footage that aired showed the 33-year-old bounce back from the injury quickly, but in reality, he'd separated his shoulder and required medical attention.\n\"Kevin kind of surprised me because I happened to be standing near him when he suddenly said, ‘I'm in pain, I'm in pain.’ And I said, ‘Can you hang a second? Can you wait a second? ‘And he said ‘No.’ I was like, ‘Okay, so he's really in pain,'\" hostJeff ProbsttoldEntertainment Weekly, who was on-site during filming.\nProbst, 63, called in the show's doctor to examine Kevin, while he wondered if it was \"a serious injury that might result in him being pulled out\" of the show. But once Kevin was given a \"temporary pain reliever\" to allow the doctor to pop his shoulder back in place, he felt \"instant relief.\"\nRobert Voets/CBS\nAfter the injury, Probst said that Kevin did \"appear to be fine\" and was well able to participate in a \"really physical\" immunity challenge shortly after.\n\"In Kevin's case, he did recover pretty quickly. I'm not saying it wasn't bothering him, but it was not so severe,\" he told the outlet.\nAs for why the injury and his medical treatment didn't make the cut for the premiere episode, Probst said there was simply too much content to fit. \"This first episode is so packed that our very first cut was very long, and you have to getSurvivorto time. And so you start asking yourself a series of questions, and the first one is: What can we cut that does not impact the vote? And that's where your most painful cuts are going to come, but you have to be able to make them.\"\nRobert Voets/CBS\nHe continued, \"Ultimately, Kevin's injury didn't directly impact the Tribal. If Kevin's voted out, it's not because of his shoulder. It wasn't serious enough to impact him that way. So that's why we removed that scene.\"\nSpeaking generally to the injury and what it reminded him about the show, which he's hosted since its debut in 2000, Probst told EW: \"What's interesting aboutSurvivoris it's so unpredictable that you can't worry about trying to predict it. So I don't ever even think there might be an injury. It never occurs to me, but in the back of my mind, I'm aware there could be an injury at any given moment.”Never miss a story — sign up forPEOPLE's free daily newsletterto stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\nSurvivorseason 48 airs Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET on CBS.",

A clip then showed the television imitating Grande’s smile in the film and taking selfies in her look.\nThe video then showed several photos of Ripa in several of Glinda’s outfits throughout the movie, including the sort pink dress she wore during “Defying Gravity” and the prep school uniform she wore during the “What Is This Feeling” segment — complete with books and a pink shoulder bag.\nKelly Ripa/Instagram; Giles Keyte/Universal Pictures\nShe ended the video with a few snaps of her posing in Glinda’s iconic pink bubble gown that she begins the movie with — with a tiara and wand to match.

The couple moved to Santa Fe, N.M., where they were tragically found dead alongside their dog on Feb. 26.\nWhile at first police shared that there was no foul play suspected in their deaths, hours later they concluded that suspicious findings — including a knocked over heater, open pill bottle and dogs running around the house — warranted a \"thorough search and investigation,” perVariety.\nAlthough Hackman was no longer living a life in the spotlight or on the big screen following his retirement, the actor wrote novels and occasionally spoke with the media to look back on his legendary career. When asked during a 2011 interview withGQabout how he would like to be remembered, Hackman replied, \"As a decent actor.\"\n\"As someone who tried to portray what was given to them in an honest fashion,\" he said. \"I don’t know, beyond that. I don't think about that often, to be honest.\"\nHere's everything we know so far about Gene Hackman's death.\nHackman and his wife, who was 65 years old, were found dead at their home in Santa Fe Summit on Feb. 26 at approximately 1:45 p.m local time, the Santa Fe County Sheriff’s office confirmed to PEOPLE.

TMZ additionally reported that there was no visible trauma discovered on the bodies of the couple according to Mendoza.\nAlthough the cause of death has yet to be determined, there is anactive and ongoing police investigationto look further into it.\nHackman's daughterElizabeth Jean Hackman, whom he welcomed with ex-wife Faye Maltese, toldTMZthat although the family remains unsure what happened, theysuspect toxic fumes, such as carbon monoxide poisoning, might have been involved.\nMendoza told the outlet that the gas company and fire department were at the scene to ensure that no toxic fumes would harm the deputies as they entered the home.\nHowever, hours later, an affidavit released by New Mexico authorities revealed that the deaths are “suspicious enough in nature to require a thorough search and investigation,” perVariety.\nIt added that police found the front door unlocked and opened while a dog was running around the property and another was near Arakawa's dead body. Additionally, a heater was moved, a pill bottle was opened with pills scattered near Arakawa and Hackman was found in a separate room, all leading to authorities' ruling to investigate further as there were \"no obvious signs of a gas leak.\nDonaldson Collection/Michael Ochs Archives/Getty\nCiting the affidavit,TMZreported that Hackman appeared to have fallen as his sunglasses were found next to his body as he was fully clothed.\nHowever, Arakawa appeared to have been dead for some time, as her body was in a state of decomposition with her face bloated and mummification in her hands and feet.",

He mentioned the weather and said 'I hope if we have to go indoors we won’t be doing the jail scene.' If you remember it’s a huge scene. Clint assured him that it wasn’t the cover scene.\"\n\"Well guess what? Weather made the schedule change and sure enough the jail scene was up first,\" continued the actress. \"And don’t you know, Gene was prepared like nobody’s business. Gene nailed it as if he’d been working for weeks! He was amazing!\"\nContinued Fisher, \"Watching his work, and working with him was a master class. And when he was waiting for shots to be set up, he’d go to his notebook and sketch. He gave me a drawing of me as Strawberry Alice that I have framed above my desk.

A deceased German Shepherd was found about 10-15 feet from Arakawa, per the outlet, while two other healthy dogs were also found on the property.\nArakawa may have been dead for a while, TMZ claims, as it allegedly appeared that \"the body was in a state of decomposition with bloating in her face and mummification in her hands and feet.\"\nJeffrey Mayer/WireImage\nHackman, meanwhile, was “fully clothed” with his sunglasses found near his body, indicating that he may have fallen down, per TMZ.\nThe outlet notes that the “fire department came and advised they did not see any signs of carbon monoxide leak or poisoning.\" The local gas company also did not find evidence pointing toward a problem with a gas leak or pipe issue.\nThe Santa Fe County Sheriff's office confirmed early on Thursday, Feb. 27 that Hackman, a two-time Oscar winner, and Arakawa, a classical pianist, werefound deadin their Santa Fe compound, along with one of their dogs.\nA spokesperson from the Santa Fe County Sheriff’s office previously told PEOPLE that foul play was not suspected and the couple’s causes of death had yet to be determined.

I will pretend that I set a timer, and I will tell them one more. And then if my task that I was trying to complete is not finished, I will say, you guys were so well behaved. I'll let you watch one more.\"\n\"Our girls have tablets, but they only get them on planes and very rarely in the house,\" she continued. \"And they are not allowed to touch phones.

Everyone gets a special day.\"\n\"When your siblings get presents for your birthday, it reduces your birthday. It's not their birthday.

On the Thursday, Jan. 23 episode, she described raising children as the \"most selfless\" and \"all-encompassing\" thing someone will do in their life.\n\"At any point in the day, you do have to always be concerned about the tiny humans you're responsible for, but I think there is a misconception that it wipes out the rest of you and makes you solely mom,\" the podcast host shared.\n\"Whereas what we need to do is tack it on to the end of the resume and keep the rest of the s--- that also defines us as who we are as people because we're still us,\" she added. \"Just because we made a human being or we are a mother to a tiny human doesn't mean that we are only mom.\"",

        "headline": "What Happened to Scott Peterson? Inside His Life in Prison Over 20 Years After He Was Convicted of Murdering Laci Peterson",
        "body": "Scott Peterson has maintained his innocence since he was convicted of murdering his wife and unborn child in 2004\nBart Ah You-Pool/Getty\nThe story shocked the world: In 2002, Laci Peterson, eight months pregnant, was found brutally murdered — and her husbandScott Petersonwas theprimary suspect. In 2004, Scott was convicted of murdering his wife and unborn son and sentenced to death.\nIn the years since, he has maintained his innocence: Scott’sdeath penalty sentence was overturnedin 2020, though he hasremained convicted of the crimes, and haslong sought a retrial.\n“That’s the last person you want to think had anything to do withthe disappearance of your daughter— her husband,” Laci’s mother, Sharon Rocha, said in the 2017 ABC specialTruth and Lies: The Murder of Laci Peterson.“The person that was a member of your family, somebody that you loved and cared about, and thought he felt the same way about your daughter. And knowing how she felt about him.”\nIn 2022, Scott was denied a new trial. In January 2024, however,Scott's case was picked up by the Los Angeles Innocence Project, a nonprofit organization known for its work to exonerate wrongly convicted and incarcerated individuals The organization told PEOPLE in a statement that they now represent Scott and are \"investigating his claim of actual innocence.\"\nUnder the nonprofit's direction,Scott's case reached a breakthroughin May 2024 when a judge ruled that one piece of evidence from the initial investigation — a piece of duct tape found on Laci's pants — could undergo DNA testing.\nIn Scott's November 2023 letter to the court, he wrote that he sought a retrial because \"critical exculpatory evidence was ignored, overlooked, or never investigated at all, and in other instances was suppressed at the time of my trial,\" perKRON4.\nScott spoke out for the first time in over 20 years in the Peacock docuseriesFace to Face With Scott Peterson, which is now streaming.\nHere’s everything to know about Scott Peterson’s crimes, his life in prison and his attempts to prove his innocence from behind bars.\nLaci Peterson disappeared on Dec. 24, 2002, while on a walk with the family dog near her home in Modesto, California, about 90 miles east of San Francisco. At the time, she was 27 years old and eight months pregnant with a baby boy the couple had decided to name Conner. Four months later,Laci’s and Conner’s bodies were discoveredwashed ashore in the San Francisco Bay. Laci had been decapitated and parts of her limbs were missing; Conner’s fetal remains were discovered outside of his mother’s body. Because their bodies were so badly decomposed, no specific cause of death could be determined.\nSuspicion fell on Scott, who claimed to be a grieving husband and father — though he had been actively having an affair withAmber Frey, whose testimony later helped to convict him. He said he went fishing alone in the San Francisco Bay on the morning of Christmas Eve.\nDetective Al Brocchini told PEOPLE in 2005 that Scott’s behavior in the days after Laci’s disappearance was a red flag. “His major concerns were not Laci,” Brocchini said. “His major concerns were his car door hitting his other car door in the driveway, or me taking a picture of this boat in his shop, or getting a receipt for the pink slipper and sunglasses the tracking-dog people used for Laci’s scent. He was concerned about the wrong things on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.”\nIn the 2017 A&E docuseriesThe Murder of Laci Peterson, detective Jon Buehler recalled thatScott had a strange reactionwhen he was told that Laci’s and Conner’s bodies had been recovered.\n“We told Scott. [There was] very little reaction on Scott’s part,” Buehler said. “In my view, because he was the one who killed Laci, there’s no reason for him to have a lot of emotion because he knew what the results were gonna be.”\nScott, however, recalled the moment differently in the A&E docuseries, claiming he had a \"really emotional, physical reaction\" to the news.\nHe was arrested on April 18, 2003, just days after the bodies were found. Policefound suspicious itemsin Scott’s car: He had a gun, about $15,000 cash, three cell phones, camping gear, various medications and two driver’s licenses. He had also dyed his hair blonde and was in his hometown of San Diego, more than 400 miles from Modesto. Police suspected that Scott intended to flee across the border to Mexico.\nTed Benson-Pool/Getty\nScott’s trial began on June 1, 2004, in Redwood City, California — about 90 miles from Modesto. The prosecution claimed that Scott’s motive in murdering his family was to collect a $250,000 life insurance policy on Laci.\nScott claimed that he was fishing alone when Laci was abducted. On Dec. 30, 2002, six days after Laci disappeared, Amber Frey — who had believed Scott was unmarried — contacted Modesto Police to inform them of her relationship with Scott. At the police’s request,she taped her phone calls with Scott. The recordings, which jurors later said portrayed Scott as dishonest and manipulative, were a major factor in swaying the jury to a guilty verdict.\n“I usually try and never let my emotions about a victim surface during a trial,” prosecutor Birgit Fladager told PEOPLE in 2005. “That was impossible here. The raw emotion and incredible sadness that filled that courtroom on many occasions seeped into your bones. It was very painful for everyone.”\nThe trial lasted five months, and the jury started their deliberations on Nov. 3, 2004. Scott was convicted of first-degree murder for Laci’s death and of second-degree murder for Conner’s. When the judgehanded down his guilty verdicton Nov. 12, 2004, Scott was “staggered by it,” he said inThe Murder of Laci Peterson.“I had no idea it was coming.”\nOn Dec. 13, 2004, the jury recommended that he be sentenced to death. The following March, Judge Alfred Delucchi upheld the jury’s suggestion and formally sentenced Scott to the death penalty.\nIn the docuseriesMurder Made Me Famous, juror John Guinasso recalled that Scott’s recorded conversations with Frey convinced him of the man’s guilt. “The Amber Frey tapes exposed him not telling the truth on several occasions,” he said. “He’s romancing another woman and then hiding out in parking lots, not even looking for his wife.\"\nJustin Sullivan/Getty\nAccording to San Quentin State Prison spokesperson Vernell Crittendon, Scott quickly adjusted to life in prison, charming the female guards and spreading the word of his new nickname, “Scottie-Too-Hottie,” which was given to him by a woman who wrote him a letter of support. Crittendon told PEOPLE that, when Scott first arrived, he received as many as 85 letters a week and frequent visits from his parents, friends and a female member of his former defense team.\n“He’s a sociopath,” Crittendon added. “As long as he’s getting all this attention, he’s going to be rather happy.”\n“Scott’s keeping his spirits pretty high,” a Peterson family friend told PEOPLE in 2005. “He has the attitude that he didn’t do anything wrong, and he’s waiting for the day when he can come out and do his ha-ha dance and tell the world, ‘See, I didn’t do it.’ ”\nWhile working on her 2012 bookLife After Murder: Five Men in Search of Redemption, investigative journalist Nancy Mullaneobserved Scott in prison. “He didn’t look depressed,” she told PEOPLE. “He looked like someone you’d see on the street playing basketball. He had his shirt off and his boxer shorts up. ... He wasn’t ripped, but he looked healthy.”\nIn 2020, theAssociated Pressreported that Scott’s name was on a list of at least 31,000 inmates to whom Californiapaid unemployment benefitsduring the COVID-19 pandemic; Scott’s attorney maintained that his client did not request or receive money from the state. In October 2022, a woman named Brandy Iglesias was arrested and charged with using Scott’s and other prisoners’ names and social security numbers to collect more than $145,000, according toAP. (Five months earlier, theLos Angeles Timesreported that 13 people were charged in connection with the same scheme.)\nCalifornia Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation/AP\nScott has maintained his innocence and continues to fight his murder conviction.\nHis attorneys have claimed that he did not have a fair trial and have long attempted to secure a retrial for their client. They claimed that juror Richelle Nicelied on her juror questionnaire andcommitted “prejudicial misconduct” by not disclosing that she hadfiled for a restraining orderagainst her boyfriend’s ex-girlfriend four years before the Peterson trial. Nice also wrote seven letters to Scott and co-authored a book with the other jurors.\nScott’s lawyers have also brought up new evidence thatcontradicts the prosecution’s timelineof the morning Laci disappeared — including that of the Petersons’ mail carrier, whose testimony suggests that Laci was alive for longer than previously thought. His attorneys also claim that neighbors saw Laci alive after Scott left the house that day.\n\"There'sevidence that was completely ignoredthat shows Laci was alive after [Scott] left for the day,\" Scott’s sister-in-law Janey Peterson toldtheTodayshowin 2021. \"But also, there was no evidence that he had anything to do with what happened to Laci.\"\nJeff Chiu/AP\nIn 2020, the California Supreme Courtoverturned his death penalty sentenceand ordered a new sentencing trial for him. The court did not overturn his conviction.\n\"Peterson contends his trial was flawed for multiple reasons, beginning with the unusual amount of pretrial publicity that surrounded the case,\" the court said in its ruling. \"We reject Peterson’s claim that he received an unfair trial as to guilt and thus affirm his convictions for murder.” The ruling also noted that the original judge \"made a series of clear and significant errors in jury selection that, under long-standing United States Supreme Court precedent, undermined Peterson’s right to an impartial jury at the penalty phase.\"\nLater that year, the California Supreme Court ruled that Scott’s case should have an additional review to determine whether he was entitled toa second trial, wherein he could possibly beexonerated and freed from prison.\nIn 2021, Stanislaus County District Attorney Birgit Fladager, who was on the prosecuting team during the original trial, announced shewouldn’t retry the penalty phase trial, upholding the court’s decision to overturn his death sentence. Scott will instead servea life sentence without parole.\nIn that sentencing hearing,Laci’s family spoke outagainst the convicted murderer. \"Nineteen years, and there's not a day that goes by that I don't think about my sister,\" said Laci’s sister Amy Rocha.\n\"There are no words able to express the pain associated with not being able to experience life together,” her brother Brent Rocha added.\n\"You betrayed her, your son and everyone else,\" Laci’s mother, Sharon Rocha, said. \"You ended two beautiful souls.\"\nAfter that hearing, a Peterson family member told PEOPLE that having his sentence scaled backwas a victory for Scott. \"He feels so gratified about that,\" the family member said. \"He feels like it's a big step towards his freedom. He's feeling positive.\"\nCalifornia Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation/AP\nIn December 2022, Judge Anne-Christine Massullodenied Scott’s request for a new trial. In her decision, Massullo wrote that Richelle Nice’s misconduct was accidental. \"The court concludes that Juror No. 7's (Nice) responses were not motivated by pre-existing or improper bias against Petitioner (Peterson),\" she wrote, \"but instead were a combination of good faith misunderstanding of the questions and sloppiness in answering.\"\nAccording to a friend, Laci’s family was pleased with the decision. \"It's a tremendous reliefto everyone who loved Laci,\" the source told PEOPLE. \"Everyone was so worried that they were going to have to go through the pain of a trial again, and no one wanted to deal with that.\"\nOn Jan. 19, 2024, the L.A. Innocence Project announced they were investigating Scott's case and said new \"evidence\" supports the claim that he did not kill Lacy and their unborn son.\n\"New evidence now supports Mr. Peterson's longstanding claim of innocence and raises many questions into who abducted and killed Laci and Conner Peterson,\" read filings first obtained by ABC News.\nThat evidence includes updated witness statements that point to multiple areas of interest, particularly a December 2002 burglary of a home across the street from the Petersons' Modesto residence. (Scott's attorneys have argued that Laci was killed after witnessing men breaking into her neighbor's home.) The organization also hopes to conduct new DNA testing on a blood-stained mattress found on Dec. 25, 2002, nearby, which could link Laci back to the burglars.\nScott's defense attorney Pat Harris told PEOPLE of the news, “We are very excited to have the incredible attorneys at the L.A. Innocence Project lend their considerable expertise to helping prove Scott Peter’s Innocence.\"\nDuring a May 29, 2024 hearing, Scott's lawyers from the LAIP argued that many important pieces of evidence — including a van that was set on fire on Dec. 25, 2002, in Modesto the day after Laci vanished, a plastic bag and a tarp — were never tested for DNA.\nKRON4reported that Scott's lawyers have evidence showing that a mattress with what appeared to be blood stains and was found inside the van wasn't there before Laci was killed. But, during the hearing, the judge ruled that only one piece of evidence could be tested, a piece of duct tape found on Laci's pants.\nAlthough the other requests for testing were denied, his lawyers maintained, perBrian Entin of News Nation, that \"there is absolutely no forensic evidence implicating Peterson.\"\nAnother update came in October 2024, when a court filing obtained byCourtTVrevealed that San Mateo County Superior Court Judge Elizabeth Hill granted Scott's lawyers access to evidence including audio and video recordings along with transcripts of suspect interviews and handwritten police notes.\nScott spoke out in a 2024 Peacock docuseries calledFace to Face with Scott Peterson. The three-part series included his side of the story, featuring the criminal case in a \"fresh\" light and Scott's first on-camera interview in more than 20 years (via FaceTime call).\nThefirst trailer for the seriespremiered in August 2024 and included the first footage of Scott on the interview call.\nIn the docuseries, Scott still maintained his innocence, though he did say he was a \"total a------ to be having sex\" while married to Laci.\n“I regret not testifying [at my trial], but if I have a chance to show people what the truth is, and if they are willing to accept it, it would be the biggest thing that I can accomplish right now — because I didn’t kill my family,\" he said in the series.",

        "body": "The late Beatles rocker's discarded lunch previously sold at auction in 1991\nJoseph Robert O’Donnell\nThere’s something in the way he chews!\nA piece of toast allegedly eaten, then discarded byGeorge Harrisonin the early 1960s has reportedly been acquired by a memorabilia dealer,The Daily Expressreports.\nJoseph O’Donnell, whosewebsitecalls him a “passionate collector of Beatles and music memorabilia,” reportedly paid an undisclosed sum for the bread, which has been kept for the last few decades in a scrapbook and was previously auctioned off in 1991.\n“It’s a brilliant story that is both bizarre, historical and a story I’ll continue telling friends, memorabilia collectors and fellow Beatles fans,” O’Donnell told theDaily Express.\nThe lore goes that a 15-year-old Beatles fan named Sue Houghton was visiting the Harrison family home when she pocketed a piece of crust that the star had left behind on his plate. She then put it in a scrapbook with the caption, “Piece of George’s breakfast. 2-8-63.”\nThe outlet reports the date in Houghton’s scrapbook as significant, as the Beatles played their final show at Liverpool’s Cavern Club, where they got their start, the very next day.\nCyrus Andrews/Michael Ochs Archives/Getty\nThe Los Angeles Timesreported in 1991 that the toast, as well as a love letterJohn Lennonwrote to his ex-wife Cynthia, fetched $94,800 at an auction in Christie’s in London.\nStill, Harrison — who died in November 2001 — joked about the authenticity of the keepsake in a 1992 interview withVOXmagazine, reportedly saying, “I ate all my toast! I never left any!”\nA popular Harrison fan page on Instagram called theHarrison Archivequotes Houghton — a young fan who was a regular at the band’s Cavern Club shows — in a 1995 interview with Yeah! magazine, saying she “concentrated on collecting parts of [the Beatles’] everyday life that would only mean something to me, things so minor that they would never miss them.”\nHarry Hammond/V&A Images/Getty\nIn that same interview, Houghton reportedly said that Harrison’s mother Louise invited her inside their home because she was a Beatles fan, and quotes her from Mark Lewisohn’s 2013 bookThe Beatles - All These Years - Extended Special Editionsaying Louise also let her rummage around in Harrison’s room whenever she went over to the house.\nThe page also shared a photo of a letterHarrison allegedly wrote Houghton, in which he thanked her for giving his mom flowers and chocolate. It also included instructions on washing his car, which Hougton later told Yeah! magazine was a joke, as she’d asked Louise if she could clean his car.\nBeatle memorabilia continue to be hot-ticket items. In May, a 12-string guitar that Lennon played during the recording ofHelp!in 1964sold for $2.85 million at auction. The instrument had been lost for 50 years before it was discovered, abandoned, in the attic of a home in the British countryside.",

It's just me and my kids and we do something at my dad and stepmom's house.\"\nWhen Kimmel responded by saying that is a \"normal\" birthday party, Kaling added, \"Yes, but you know in L.A., when Maroon 5 isn't showing up to sing, you feel guilty.

        "body": "If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation.\nDemi Moore and Katie Holmes have worn crewneck knits, too\nRandy Holmes/Disney; Amazon\nThere’s no denyingOprah Winfreyhas her book club picks down to a science — but the sweater she just wore is the true page turner.\nIn a recent episode ofThe Oprah Podcast, the media mogul chatted with author Eric Puchner about his book,Dream State. While the multigenerational novel sounds like one I’m immediately adding to the top of my must-read list, I have to admit I was equally intrigued by Winfrey’s lightweight crewneck sweater with ribbed trim. She finished the brown monochromatic look with complementary wide-leg trousers and espresso heeled boots.\nAs a lifelong fan of crewneck sweaters, I’m head over heels for Winfrey’s version, which has a slightly chunkier knit for a nubby, textured look. It’s a versatile closet staple that works for both winter’s frigid temperatures and spring’s in-between weather. I’m envisioning teaming it with wool pants and boots like she did now, and then transitioning to a skirt and canvas sneakers when it warms up.\nWinfrey isn’t the only celeb reaching for brown crewneck sweaters as of late;Martha StewartandDemi Mooreboth styled them in monochromatic looks like Winfrey, andKatie Holmesslipped one on, too. Not to mentionPamela Anderson,Reese Witherspoon, andGwyneth Paltrowhave all been spotted in other versions of crewneck sweaters recently.\nIf you, like me, can’t wait to copy Winfrey’s monochromatic brown outfit, you’ll need a lightweight knit or two. I rounded up eightcrewneck sweaters on Amazon. And the best part? They’re all under $40.\nAmazon\nThis crewneck sweater is fashioned from soft knit viscose with elongated cuffs and ribbed trim. In addition to light brown like Winfrey’s, it comes in 15 colors like royal blue, red, light pink, and black, and sizes S–XL.\nAmazon\nIf you like the chunkier knit of Winfrey’s sweater, try this oversized style with stitched raglan sleeves and side hem vents.One reviewer, who received the sweater for free, said it’s “incredibly versatile and can be paired with jeans, skirts, leggings, or even dressed up for [the] office.”\nAmazon\nThanks to celebs likeEva Longoria,Kelly Clarkson, andOprah Winfrey, I’ve been adding multiple espresso-hued items to my closet this season. I’m loving this loose-fitting crewneck sweater, which is designed with a unique back-slit detail and hits right below the hips on most people.\nAmazon\nThe higher crewneck collar and thicker knit lend this sweater a similar vibe to the one Winfrey wore, while the contrast trim details create a sporty vibe. Happy shoppers said it’s “perfect for in-between weather” and “comfortable to wear all day.”\nAmazon\nI’m drawn to this crewneck sweater as much for the roomy fit as for the elbow-length sleeves with drop shoulders. Wear it under a blazer withbaggy jeansnow, and then on its own with a mini skirt and booties in the spring.\nAmazon\nThere are multiple Cupshe sweaters in my closet, and this one, with its crochet sleeves and vertical ribbed-knit shoulders, is definitely joining my collection. It comes in both light and dark shades of brown, as well as black, blue, green, and gray, and sizes S–XL.\nAmazon\nFrom the loose, slouchy fit to the horizontal ribbed-knit pattern, this crewneck sweater makes a casual yet fashionable statement. It comes in 23 colors, including multiple shades of Winfrey-coded brown and beige, and sizes S–XXL.\nAmazon\nIf you prefer a sweater with a slimmer fit, try this one, which is designed with a crewneck collar, ribbed trim, and a hem that hits right below the hips on most people. It’s racked up over 3,000 five-star ratings;one happy shopperwho’s bought it in multiple colors said it can be “dressed up or down,” adding that it’s “great to layer over a button-up or [wear] by itself.”",

        "body": "The two-time Oscar winner and star of 'The French Connection' and 'Superman,' has died at 95 alongside his wife Betsy Arakawa\nGene Hackman, the screen actor with iconic roles inThe French ConnectionandSuperman, has died. He was 95.\nThe bodies of the actor and his wife, classical pianist Betsy Arakawa, 64, were found at their home in Santa Fe Summit on Wednesday, Feb. 26.\nA spokesperson for the Santa Fe County Sheriff’s office tells PEOPLE that deputies were dispatched to a home in Old Sunset Trail in Hyde Park where Hackman, Arakawa and one dog were found dead. Foul play is not suspected at this time, they add, and causes of death are still being determined in the ongoing investigation.\nVera Anderson/WireImage; Jim Smeal/Ron Galella Collection via Getty\nBorn Eugene Allen Hackman in San Bernardino, California, in 1930, he moved frequently with his family, eventually landing in Danville, Illinois, where his father worked for a newspaper press. As a boy, Hackman often found himself escaping to movie theaters, where he idolized stars like Erroll Flynn, Edward G. Robinson and his favorite, Jimmy Cagney.\nWhen Hackman was 13, his father left the family, waving a hand to his son as he left. “It was so precise. Maybe that’s why I became an actor,” Hackman once toldVanity Fairin 2013 of that parting gesture. “I doubt I would’ve become so sensitive to human behavior if that hadn’t happened to me as a child — if I hadn’t realized how much one small gesture can mean.”\nThree years later, after a night in jail for stealing candy and soda, Hackman enlisted in the Marines, serving until he was 19. After his discharge, he bounced around, living in New York, Florida and his childhood home, Danville, and marrying his girlfriend, Faye Maltese, in 1956. (They would divorce 30 years later.) The pair later moved to California, where Hackman joined the famed Pasadena Playhouse. While there, Hackman forged a friendship with another aspiring actor, Dustin Hoffman.\nHackman, however, was kicked out of the Playhouse and, deciding to prove them wrong, headed to New York City where he was determined to make it as an actor. He landed a small part in a two-week production of Arthur Miller’s playA View from the Bridge.\nIn New York, Hackman kicked around for years, hanging out with Hoffman andRobert Duvall, taking small parts as they came. It wasn’t until he was in his mid-thirties that Hackman finally landed a role that got him noticed, playingWarren Beatty‘s brother inBonnie and Clyde(1967). As Buck Barrow in the incendiary film, Hackman earned his first Oscar nomination in 1968 out of five.\nThree years later, Hackman was nominated for a second Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role in the 1970’sI Never Sang for My Father. But it was his leading role in 1971’sThe French Connectionthat solidified his status as a Hollywood leading man and earned him the Oscar for Best Actor in 1972.\nHackman pursued more diverse roles in 1972’sThe Poseidon Adventure,Francis Ford Coppola’s 1974 filmThe Conversation(1974) where Hackman plays a surveillance expert who thinks a couple is about to be murdered.\nHe also portrayed a hard-charging coach in 1986’sHoosiers, the war-mongering submarine captain inCrimson Tide(1995).\nAnd he was Lex Luthor in the 1978 filmSuperman, which may have seemed an odd choice of vehicle for a man bent on making his bones as a serious actor, but with more than 80 movies on his resume, Hackman made room for silliness.\nFor every bit of fun like the animated filmAntz(1998) orThe Birdcage(1996) with Robin Williams and Nathan Lane, there were indelible turns inMississippi Burning, which earned Hackman his fourth Academy Award nomination in 1989, and Clint Eastwood’sUnforgiven, for which Hackman took home his second Oscar in 1993, as a loathsome sheriff.\nHackman retired from acting after starring in the 2004 comedyWelcome to Mooseport. Just a few years before, he’d once again thrilled audiences in Wes Anderson’sThe Royal Tenenbaumsas the dying patriarch of a family of kooky geniuses (including Anjelica Huston, Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Stiller and Luke Wilson). But after a career that spanned cinema’s rebirth in the late ’60s to the new century, Hackman decided he’d done enough.\nIn 2004, Hackman told Larry King in an interview that his career was “probably all over,” and that he had no new scripts in front of him. Confirming his retirement in 2008, he expanded on his thoughts several years later, tellingGQin 2011 that it would take a lot for him to make another film.\n“I don’t know.If I could do it in my own house, maybe, without them disturbing anything and just one or two people,” he said, later telling the outlet that he just hopes to be remembered “as a decent actor.”\nWhile on a book tour for his novelEscape from Andersonvillein 2008, Hackman told theRaleigh News & Observerhe didn’t want to “keep pressing” and risk “going out on a sour note.“I feel comfortable with what I’ve done,” he said.\nNever miss a story — sign up forPEOPLE's free daily newsletterto stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\nHackman turned to painting and did voice-over work and writing books. He penned the old west storyPayback at Morning Peak(2011) and the police thrillerPursuit(2013), as well as co-authoring three works of historical fiction with undersea archeologist Daniel Lenihan.\nHe has since narrated two documentary films:The Unknown Flag Raiser of Iwo Jim(2016)and We, the Marines(2017).\nIn addition to one of the most staggering filmographies in the business, his writing, theater notices and his painting, Hackman leaves behind histhree childrenwho he shared with his first wife, Maltese: Christopher Allen, Elizabeth Jean and Leslie Ann Hackman.\nAsked byGQin 2011 as to how he would like to be remembered, Hackman humbly replied, “As a decent actor. As someone who tried to portray what was given to them in an honest fashion. I don’t know, beyond that.”",

Students there are encouraged to be inspired by the sights and flora in Charles' garden at Highgrove when creating their designs.\nThe King's Foundation\nWhen PEOPLEvisited in the summer, Angelica Ellis from London said she drew inspiration for her idea from the garden's purple and orange blooms of crocuses.\n\"Here, it is all about protecting traditional crafts, which is something I care about too,\" she said. \"You see the benefits in France where they're quite good at producing and keeping their skills. The project here is super important. There are things that the tutors here have given me that I don’t think you get anywhere else.”",

In the 1980s, Michael had a successful acting career, appearing on popular shows likeGuiding LightandDallas,and in films likeDeadly Illusion.He married Brooke Palance in 1982, and together they had a son, Tarquin Wilding, in 1989.\nWhen they were younger, Michael's three children spent a lot of time with their grandmother. \"She had an idea that she was responsible for raising the younger generations in the family, you know,\" Naomi toldTodayin 2021. \"It was important to her that she instilled those values in us too.”\nDespite the fact that the family was all over the globe, Laela described them all as very close.\n“Family was number one for her,” Laela told PEOPLE in 2016. “We had a family where we all loved one another – her children and her grandchildren and it comes from her desire to bring us all together.”\n“I’ve never felt more alive than watching my children delight in something,” Taylor said, according to herwebsite.\nToday, Michael is a sculptor and lives in Santa Fe, NM, with his wife. “I’m very moved by the shapes that occur when earth, wind and water have their way with the environment,” reads his gallery artist bio. “These are collaborations which sometimes result in great elegance and grace. I’m also interested in conveying a sense of fluidity and movement in the work. For me, sculpting is also a collaboration, a kind of improvisational journey, a conversation with stone.\"\nAll three of Michael’s children are involved with the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation, which became the actor’s main passion in her later years. “I often think about how lucky I am to have been born into a group of such wacky, caring, sensitive people,” Tarquin toldTown & Countryin 2017. “We admire my grandmother for her boundless generosity, and I believe that we all feel grateful to be able to honor and continue her legacy. Especially together.”\n\"We know, quite simply, that the world is a better place for Mom having lived in it,”Michael once said about his mother. \"Her legacy will never fade, her spirit will always be with us, and her love will live forever in our hearts.”\nJ. Vespa/WireImage\nTaylor and Wilding's second son, Christopher Wilding, was born on Feb. 27, 1955.\nDespite the enormous scrutiny and media attention Taylor faced, she did her best to shield her children from it. \"Christopher Wilding once said to me, 'My mother protected us from the circus,’ ” William J. Mann, author ofHow to Be a Movie Star: Elizabeth Taylor in Hollywood, told ABC, according to Taylor’s website. \"That didn't mean they didn't see paparazzi — sometimes, there was no way to avoid it. In general, she was very protective of them.\"\nChristopher married oil heiress Aileen Getty in 1981, and the pair had two sons: Caleb, born in 1983, and Andrew, born in 1984. Christopher and Getty divorced in 1989 and he went on to wed Margaret Carlton. They had a son, Lowell, in 1992.\nHe has worked as a photographer and in films as a sound editor for movies likeTombstoneandOverboard,but is now retired. As of 2016, Christopher lives with his wife in Calabasas, Calif., according toThe Hollywood Reporter.\n“She was so beautiful, some people tended to overlook her great acting chops, Christopher told the outlet of Taylor. “I think if she were around today, she’d be most pleased with her philanthropic work,” he told the paper.\nRon Galella/Ron Galella Collection/Getty\nTaylor's first daughter and only child with husband Todd, Elizabeth “Liza” Todd, was born on Aug. 6, 1957.\nWhen Liza was an infant, her father died in a plane crash, leaving Taylor a grieving widow with three children under 5 years old. The actress later married Burton, who adopted Liza. As a child, Liza attended boarding school in Switzerland but also spent time on her mother’s movie sets.\nLiza chose to pursue a career in art, attending Hornsey College of Art in London and the Art Institute in Los Angeles. Now, she lives in upstate New York, and is an accomplished sculptor, especially known for her equine pieces.\nLiza marriedartist Hap Tiveyin 1984, and they had two sons, Quinn Tivey, born in 1986, and Rhys Tivey, born in 1990. The couple have since divorced.\nQuinn is one of the trustees of the House of Taylor and of the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation and works oncontinuing his grandmother’s legacy of activism. “The fight against HIV/AIDS was such a vital part of her legacy, and although the fight is far from over, I'm honored to see ETAF continue her work — educating legislators, raising awareness for the public, disproving myths and decreasing fear and stigma,” he wrote in an essay for PEOPLE in 2021. “I know grandma would be proud of this work too.”\nSonia Moskowitz/Getty\nBefore marrying Burton, Taylor was in the process of adopting daughter Maria McKeown, who was born on Jan. 8, 1961. Burton eventually adopted Maria as well.\nAs she grew, Maria dabbled in modeling, but has largely led a private life. She married Richard Carson and they had daughter Elizabeth “Eliza” Carson in 1982. After their divorce, she married Thomas McKeown. They welcomed son Richard McKeown in 2001, but ultimately divorced.\nInspired by her grandmother, Eliza is also an ambassador for the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation.",

I didn’t miss graduations, I showed up for sporting events and whatever I could and a lot of times, I had to be the disciplinarian.”\nNelly also opened up about his sister’s death and taking in Sydney and Shawn. He reflected on the family’s grief, explaining, “As bad as I felt and whatever I was going through, I can’t imagine what they [Sydney and Shawn] were going through. It’s one of those situations that you don’t think about, it has to happen, that’s what family does.”\nHere is everything to know about Nelly’s five children — Shawn, Chanelle, Sydney, Cornell and Kareem.\nLil Shxwn Instagram\nNelly adopted Shawn, often called Lil' Shawn, in 2005 when his sister Jackie died of leukemia — he was 8 at the time.\nNelly celebrated his extended family for their assistance during this difficult period of grief and family transition during a September 2020 appearance on theTamron Hallshow.\n“I wouldn’t be anything without the help of her [Jackie's] mother and family members and my brother,” Nelly said. “Even though I possibly beared the financial part of it and a lot of discipline part when it had to come down to it, but I definitely had to have help.”\nShawn starred inNellyvillewith his whole family and has released music in the past, but now he seems more focused on his growing family.

She works on her music and she has a radio show up and coming real soon as well that she’s getting ready to do.”\nOn Chanelle's birthday in February 2021, Nelly posted a cute throwback photo of the pair and captioned the post, \"Happy Bday to my first born Daddy’s girl.. love you to the moon 🌚 and back..!!\"\nChanelle has one child named Ace.

Because I don’t know where I would be without them, without their genuine spirit of having that love around.\"\nNelly has also reflected on how much parenting has changed since he was a kid and how that affected his choices with his four kids. The rapper toldHuffPost Livein 2014 that parenting today is “definitely different” than when he grew up.\n“As much blame as we give a lot of our kids for what they'renotdoing ... I also try to give them as much credit for dealing with things that we didn't have to deal with,” he said. “Bullying was one-on-one and face-to-face. Now it's all over the internet.”\nNelly also reflected on the unique challenges that the children of celebrities face. \"Everybody voices their opinion and then when it stops at them, all of a sudden their opinion is coming because of who their father is,” he told the outlet. “But I tell them that all the time, too.

They’re always in my closet and I dip down in their room and snatch a hat.”\nDescribing their shared tastes, Nelly continued: “We talk about the same things, we like the same music — a majority of it, sometimes they go a little far. I still understand that you have to let the youth be the youth and you got to let them make their own mistakes. But it’s also important to understand that you’ve got to guide them.”\nLike his father, Cornell is also family-oriented and has been praised by Nelly for being “such a respectful young man,” including with his great-grandmother.\nCornell has a close-knit relationship with his sister, Chanelle, too. For his 24th birthday in March 2023, sheshared a videofeaturing photos with her younger brother. “Y’all go wish the greatest gift my parents could give me in life a happy birthday,” Chanelle captioned the post. “You’re strength is unmatched, your heart is made of gold.”\nShe also shared her pride in her younger brother and his “creative choices” and referred to him as an “inspiration.” Cornell describes himself as a producer on his Instagram.\nNelly and his wife,Ashanti, welcomed their son,Kareem Kenkaide Haynes, on July 18, 2024.\n\"The proud and happy parents are so in love with KK!\" a rep for the couple told PEOPLE.\nThe \"Baby\" singer also spoke withEntertainment Tonightabout thespecial meaning behind Kareem's middle name.\n\"Kenkaide is my dad’s name and obviously my dad has only girls, so Nelly was just like, ‘I think that would be really dope.’ This was all his idea,\" Ashanti shared.\nElsewhere in the interview, she described Kareem as \"my twin\" and said, \"This little boy has my entire soul wrapped around his finger.\"\nIn November 2024, Nelly toldETthat his wife treats Kareem like a \"Build-A-Bear.\"\n\"The boy is 3 months.

He shares his late daughter Charlotte and sons Christopher, 52, and Sean, 41, with his first wife, the late actress Cassandra Harris. He also shares sons Dylan, 28, and Paris, 24, with wifeKeely Shaye Smith.\n\"My fatherly instinctsare purely my own,\" he toldEsquirein 2017 of his parenting. (Pierce was raised by his maternal grandparents as his father left when he was a baby and his mother moved to London to work when he was just 4). \"They relate back to no one, because there was no one. I only met [my dad] the once. … I had a Sunday afternoon with him.\"\nHis goal has always been to make his kids \"feel like they belong\" and \"know the love of family,\" he toldReader's Digestin 2008. \"I'm very aware of how precious the time with my children is.\"\nThe deaths of his wife Cassandra in 1991 and daughter Charlotte in 2013 — both due to ovarian cancer — brought that awareness to the forefront. \"[Life] can be snatched away without any prior warning, so why waste it?\" he toldThe Heraldin 2015. \"That's whyI enjoy my wonderful, beautiful family, my children and my grandchildren.\"\nPierce alsotaught his kidsthe skills they'd need to succeed at anything — \"preparation, passion, confidence, showing up on time,\" according to Dylan — but there's one career from which he steers them away: his own.\n\"Just because [acting is] f------ hard work,\" he toldGQin 2022. \"It's a cross to bear. You're constructing and destroying yourself.\"\nHere's everything to know about Pierce Brosnan's children and what he's shared about parenting over the years.\nCharlotte Emily Brosnan(née Harris) was born on Nov. 27, 1971, in London to Cassandra and Dermot Harris, brother of actor Richard Harris. Cassandra and Dermot divorced in 1978, and she married Pierce in 1980.\nAfter Dermot's death in 1986, Pierce adopted Charlotte and her younger brother, Christopher, and they both took his last name.\nAccording to family friend Nancy Ellison, Piercenicknamed his daughterthe \"custodian of laughter\" and took great joy in \"always being able to make Charlotte laugh.\" Ellison described Charlotte as \"a bubbly, almost kind of goofy, gorgeous girl.\"\nShe went on to study at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London and worked as an actress before focusing on raising her children.\nCharlotte was 20 years old when her motherdied of ovarian cancer. \"There is an incredible cruelty in it all, losing a person you shared everything with,\" Pierce told PEOPLE in 1992 of the \"overwhelming\" experience. The actor also said he spoke to his daughter on the phone daily. \"You just feel more deeply now. You hug more deeply, you love more deeply.\"\nCharlotte welcomed two children of her own, Isabella and Lucas, with her longtime partner Alex Smith, whom she married in June 2013. However, a few weeks after their wedding, Charlotte died from the same cancer her mother had at 41 years old.\n\"Charlotte fought her cancer with grace and humanity, courage and dignity,\" Pierce told PEOPLE at the time. \"Our hearts are heavy with the loss of our beautiful dear girl.\"\nIn 2014, Pierce spoke about his late wife and daughter at a Stand Up To Cancer fundraiser. \"To watch someone you love have his or her life eaten away bit by bit by this insidious disease, that part of your sorrow becomes an indelible part of your psyche,\" he said, according toEntertainment Tonight. \"I held the generous, strong, beautiful hand of my first wife Cassie as ovarian cancer took her life much too soon. Just last year, I held the hand of my funny, wonderful daughter Charlotte before she, too, died from this wretched inherited disease.\"\nPierce honored his daughter on theseventh anniversary of her deathin 2020 by sharing a photo from his porch in Hawaii.\n\"Here's looking at you kid,\" he wrote in the caption. \"In remembrance of Charlotte.\"\nChristopher Ivan Brosnan was born to Cassandra and Dermot Harris on Nov. 11, 1972, in London. Like his older sister Charlotte, he was adopted by Pierce as a teenager.\nChristopher was 19 when his mother died. \"I can see the pain in Christopher's eyes, the absence in his heart for his mother,\" Pierce told PEOPLE in 1992.\nHe later studied screenwriting at UCLA and directing at the New York Film Academy, per a2006 press release.\nEarly in his career, Chris worked on the production side of several of his father's films, includingTomorrow Never Dies, The World Is Not EnoughandThe Thomas Crown Affair. In 2006, Chris appeared onCelebrity Love Island.\nToday, Christopher lives a private life. In 2022, Pierce posted anInstagramphoto for Father's Day and mentioned Chris in his caption. \"My love forever to you dear sons, Paris, Dylan, Sean and Christopher,\" he wrote. \"Thank you deeply for your love ❤️ on this Father's Day.\"\nPierce and Cassandra welcomed their sonSean William Brosnanon Sept. 13, 1983, in Los Angeles.\nSean was 8 years old when his mother died, and he later recalled learning about it on the podcastInner Space with Dr. Barbara Van Dahlen. \"I remember the day my dad told me she passed, and it was a few days after Christmas,\" he said. \"He started to cry, but I didn't cry. I was comforting him.\"\nSean said it wasn't until \"maybe six months later\" that he understood his mom wouldn't be coming back. \"That is when it transitioned into anger,\" he added.\nThe anger affected how he acted in school; Sean said he went from being a \"somewhat popular\" kid to an outcast. \"It was pretty lonely and pretty isolating,\" he shared, noting that he had begun experimenting with drugs around that time. Things got worse when Sean, then 16, was in a serious car accident — a trauma that led to a painkiller addiction.\n\"I broke my back and shattered my tailbone, my pelvis in five places, my left femur,\" he told Van Dahlen. \"I pretty much had to learn how to walk again. I tasted opioids for the first time in the hospital.\"\nSean graduated from the Central School of Speech and Drama hoping to become an actor like his dad. He performed with the now-defunct British Shakespeare Company and had roles on MTV'sDubplate Dramaand inA West Texas Children StorywithVal Kilmer, all while struggling with addiction.\nHe had \"about a year and a half of sobriety,\" but relapsed when his older sister Charlotte died in 2013. \"I drank on the plane on the way there. The insidious part of the disease was that I almost used it as an excuse,\" he said. \"That is my addict in me saying 'Yes, I can drink, and no one can blame me.' \"\nSean got serious about sobriety in 2014 when he found love with and married actress Sanja Banic.\n\"I did a bunch of amazing things in that kind of year and it was a very spiritual process,\" he said in 2019. \"It was a healing time and just being by myself, and then with my wife, getting married and driving across America, it was all very free.\"\nIn 2015, they welcomed their first child, Marley May Cassandra Brosnan. Seven years later, their sonJaxxon Elijahwas born.\n\"All good blessings to you my dearest grandson, welcome,\" Pierce shared in an Instagram post. \"Congratulations my darling Sean, Sanja and Marley. Peace be with you.\"\nSean has since pivoted from the film industry to the mental health field. \"I started as a residence adviser at a treatment center and realized I want to become a clinician and psychologist,\" he told Van Dahlen. \"Right now I am [working] in addiction but I kind of want to do grief and loss.\"\nPierce and his now-wife Keely Shaye Smith welcomed sonDylan Thomas Brosnanon Jan. 13, 1997, in L.A.\nDylan grew up in Kauai, Hawaii, and as a teen, began splitting his time between the island and Malibu, California. \"Kids would be like, 'Oh, yeah — you're that guy. I went to fifth grade with you for, like, one week and then you left,' \" he toldGQabout hisunusual upbringingin September 2022.\nHe also spent his childhoodvisiting his dad's film sets. \"Do you remember coming down to the James Bond set [for]Die Another Day?\" Pierce asked Dylan in a live chat on PEOPLE's Instagram in 2021. \"That was really cool,\" Dylan responded. \"I was really young, but I loved the cars … and you had the cars, you had the hovercrafts, and I was really obsessed with the hovercrafts.\"\nPierce joked that Dylan was more excited about the cars than he was about watching him film an action sequence. \"I had to dive and weave my way through this minefield, and I always remember standing there thinking, 'There's my boy. There's Dylan,' \" he recalled. \"I could see you across the lot in this massive moment that was about to happen. … And I got to the end of it and I said, 'How was it?' And you said, 'Are the cars okay, Daddy?' \"\nNow an adult, Dylan graduated from the University of Southern California's School of Cinematic Arts in the spring of 2020. He is now a filmmaker with several credits to his name, includingWestern StarswithBruce Springsteenand the docu-seriesWillie Nelson & Family.

We play ukulele. My wife is an ace gardener, and the kids get in the mud with her.\"\nThough Pierce was a very loving father, Paris said that he could lay down the law when necessary. \"I mean, he's an actor, so he can get medieval real quick as he would say,\" Paris told PEOPLE for the 2022 Sexiest Man Alive issue. \"We keep it pretty mellow. But he could put on an energy that was a force to be reckoned with!\"\nAt 24 years old, Paris has already worked as a model, filmmaker and environmental activist.

I'm over the moon for both of our sons.\"\nMost recently,Paris graduated from Loyola Marymount Universityin May 2023.\n\"Go into the world with a brave heart and create stories that will make the world a better place @paris.brosnan,\" Pierce wrote in a congratulatory Instagram post.",

        "body": "Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck were married from 2005 to 2018 and share three children together — Violet, Seraphina and Samuel\nKarli Bendlin is the Director of Content Strategy at PEOPLE. She has over nine years of editorial experience covering entertainment, beauty, and lifestyle, and has been working at PEOPLE since 2022.\nJennifer GarnerandBen Affleckare famously proud — and private — parents.\nTheYes Dayactress and theGone Girlstar split in 2015 after 10 years of marriage, officially divorcing three years later. Together, they co-parent their three children: Violet Anne, 19,Seraphina Rose, 16, andSamuel, 13.\nOver the years, the former pair have worked hard to keep their kids out of the spotlight, particularly regarding paparazzi photos and social media. In 2013, Garner joined a group of celebrity parents led byHalle Berryto pass a bill thatoutlawed paparazzi photos of childrentaken without permission. She's also been outspoken about her decision to keep her kids off social media, saying she doesn't \"see anything positive\" from it.\nDespite Garner and Affleck's best efforts to preserve their children's privacy, the family has had to weather several public ups and downs over the years. In January 2022, Affleck told theLos Angeles Timesthat he worried about how his kids would handle his public perception, explaining that he paid little mind to the media attention surrounding him until his children began to see it.\n\"I got to a place where [the public perception] was so different from who I am that I just stopped reading and stopped caring,\" he said. \"But then, as my kids got older and started seeing the Internet themselves, that's the difficult part.\"\nSpeaking toGood Morning Americain December 2021, the two-time Academy Award winner added that the only opinion of him that matters is that of his children.\n\"I will be long dead and someone will ask my kids, 'What was your dad like?' and that is when I will know what my life was worth,\" he said.\nAffleck has also said that he considers his kidswhen making career moves. In fact, getting more time with his kids was one reason he began his production company, Artists Equity, which allows him to be in Los Angeles more.\n\"One of the reasons I did it was, I'm divorced. I share custody. I don't want to go to Austin and New Orleans and Georgia anymore and not see my kids,\" he toldThe Hollywood Reporterin an interview published in March 2023.\n\"It just doesn't work. These years are too important. If I miss them, I'll regret it for the rest of my life,\" he added.Since getting divorced, Garner and Affleck moved on to other relationships. The13 Going on 30star has beendating CEO John Milleron and off since 2018, while Affleck was married toJennifer Lopezfor two years before shefiled for divorcein August 2024.\nFrom their early reflections on raising children to how they're navigating life with teenagers, here's everythingJennifer GarnerandBen Affleckhave said about parenting.\nGarner and Affleck welcomed their first child,Violet, on Dec. 1, 2005. \"Mother, father and baby are doing great,\" a rep for the couple told PEOPLE at the time. Violet shares a middle name, Anne, with her mom.\nTwo years after welcoming Violet, Garnergushed about Affleck's parenting skillsduring a 2007 interview withInStyle.\n\"You know how as a kid you picture yourself with a tall, handsome husband, and you imagine him cuddling your baby? Ben is that, like, on crack,\" she said. \"Granted, I still obsess: 'Do you know what you're doing?' … But Violet prefers him to anyone. He's a teddy bear of a guy. Nothing makes me happier than to see the two of them together and her little hands on his face.\" She added that she admired his \"prevailing calm,\" which stemmed from a slight advantage: \"Of course, he has the benefit of sleep.\"\nFrom the beginning of their parenting journey, Garner and Affleck did their best to keep their children out of the spotlight, which proved difficult given the intense media attention surrounding their relationship. When she was just a kindergartener, Violet was already dealing with the paparazzi, as Garner explained in a March 2021 cover story forThe Hollywood Reporter.\nThe actress recalled a time when Violet spoke out about the traumatic experience of being constantly photographed. \"She stood up on a chair in a little velvet dress, with her hair a bit back and her glasses on and she didn't say her R's right, and she said: 'We didn't ask for this. We don't want these cameras, they're scary. The men are scary, they knock each other over and it's hard to feel like a kid when you're being chased.' \"\nGarner noted that the constant attention \"put so much anxiety in our little family,\" which was one of the reasons she was inspired to help to pass a bill that made it a crime for paparazzi to photograph children without permission.\n\"Anywhere that we went it was a total circus,\" she said during a conversation on PBS'Tell Me More With Kelly Corriganin October 2020, adding that the paparazzi had a profound impact on her kids' childhoods, particularly when it came to their firstborn. \"My one daughter tried to play soccer and it was such a zoo for the families that they just said, 'Can you please not,' \" Garner explained.\nOut of the spotlight, however, Garner and Affleck raised their kids with whatever sense of normalcy they could. When Violet was a preteen, Garner expressed her fears over giving her a laptop, explaining that she relented after learning Violet was the only kid in her class without one — but also admitting that she was \"kind of panicked\" about it.\n\"She's not on social media yet — her school has a no social media policy until 6th grade — but I know it's coming soon,\" Garner toldTodayin 2016.\nThe actress echoed her concerns about social media again in 2019, explaining that shewouldn't let Violet join Instagram.\n\"She'll occasionally talk to me about getting Instagram, and I can see why because I'm on there and it's something kind of fun that I do, and I am modeling the opposite of what I want for her to do,\" Garner toldKatie Couric. \"How often is that in parenting?\"\nAnd though Violet's parents are both A-list actors, that doesn't mean they're immune from getting humbled by their kids. Affleck revealed at a February 2020 screening of his filmThe Way Backthat Violet would\"tease\" himover his emoji usage in a group chat with his younger costars.\n\"My daughter is so funny, she teases me, she's 14 and she's like 'Why do they let you on this group chat? You don't know what you're talking about. Don't pretend you have any idea what's going on,' \" Affleck laughed. \"Then she's like, 'What are they saying on the group chat?' which is only appropriate very rarely for my daughter, but it's a lot of fun. It's a way to stay in touch. It's fun.\"\nWhile Violet has still largely managed to stay out of the spotlight, for her 17th birthday in 2022, the teenmade a rare public appearancewith Garner at aState dinnerhosted by PresidentJoe Bidenand First Lady Dr.Jill Biden. In July 2023,Violet stepped outagain, this time with her dad andJennifer Lopez, for Fanatics CEO Michael Rubin's White Party.\nNow that Violet is almost all grown up, Garner has looked back on her parenting style. For a cover story withAllurein May 2023, Garner shared that she was a\"nightmare\" as a first-time mom.\n\"My eldest daughter [Violet] didn't have a shot,\" she said. \"She couldn't have a free thought — I was all over her. I was a nightmare for everyone around me.\"\nIn July 2024, Violetstood before the L.A. County Board of Supervisorsand advocated for mask availability and free COVID-19 testing.\n\"One in 10 infections leads to long COVID, which is a devastating neurological [and] cardiovascular illness that can take away people's ability to work, move, see, and even think,\" she said. \"To confront the long COVID crisis, I demand mask availability, air filtration and far-UVC light in government facilities, including jails and detention centers, and mask mandates in county medical facilities.\"\nThe soon-to-be college student ended her comments by opposing mask bans. \"They do not keep us safer, they make vulnerable members of our community less safe and make everyone less able to participate in Los Angeles together,\" she said.\nVioletwill attend Yale Universityin the fall of 2024.\nGarner and Affleck welcomed their second child on Jan. 6, 2009. Seven days later, the couple's reprevealed their newborn's nameexclusively to PEOPLE: Seraphina Rose Elizabeth Affleck.\nAhead of Seraphina's birth, Garner and Affleck's palBradley Cooperspoke to PEOPLE about the couple expanding their family, noting that he thought the pair would be \"perfect\" parents.\n\"She was a great leader for a TV show I did with her and she can literally do anything. So she can certainly run a family,\" Cooper said of Garner, hisAliascostar. \"She will have no problems having two kids.\"\nIn 2012, Garner said that Affleck was excelling as a dad. \"He's all about [tea parties]. He can do it without using any energy at all,\" she said during an appearance onThe Ellen DeGeneres Show. \"He can sit there and be almost asleep and they think they're having an incredible game with him. It's skill.\"\nAnd while Affleck and Garner quickly settled into their new role as parents of two, Affleck later revealed that having multiple children made him rethink how he approached his career and work schedule.\n\"My life has really changed a lot. Once I had kids, it became very obvious to me that the priority was time with them,\" he told PEOPLE in 2021 when he was working onThe Tender Barwith his longtime palGeorge Clooney, who directed the film.\n\"George was spectacular in that way,\" Affleck said of the director. \"He's a dad too and would let me out on the weekends or cut me early. He really understood and appreciated how important it was for me to see my kids.\"\nThe actor added that prioritizing family over work became especially important \"when I got divorced and had half the time. ... So I'm trying to fit a whole week of dad into three and a half days, [it's] hard and stressful. My standards really changed. I don't want to go travel and do something if it's not really rewarding and meaningful. Yeah, I have to work. The kids know I have to work. Their mom has to work. They understand that. But it's not like I'm some martyr for my kids. I get more out of it than anything else,\" he shared.\nGarner and Affleckannounced they were divorcingafter 10 years of marriage in June 2015, when Violet was 9, Seraphina was 6 and Samuel was 3.\nThe following year, Affleck gave an update on how their co-parenting journey was going whilespeaking toE! Newsat the March 2016Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justicepremiere. \"Jen is a superhero mom. She is an amazing mother and I'm really lucky to have her as a partner to co-parent these kids with. We try our best, we put them first and that's what we do.\"\nIn her first major post-split interview, Garner revealed toVanity Fairin 2016 that while she was still getting over their romantic relationship, she and Affleck were \"completely in line\" with their dreams for their kids.\n\"It's not Ben's job to make me happy,\" she told the outlet. \"The main thing is these kids — and we're completely in line with what we hope for them. Sure, I lost the dream of dancing with my husband at my daughter's wedding. But you should see their faces when he walks through the door. And if you see your kids love someone so purely and wholly, then you're going to be friends with that person.\"\nIn 2018, the former couple reunited tohost a party for Seraphina's 9th birthday. \"It was a small celebration,\" a source told PEOPLE. \"Ben was there too. Seraphina had friends over for cake and got a lot of gifts.\"\nSeraphina, now 16, has also seemingly embraced being a part of a larger blended family after Affleck married Lopez, as she's been spottedspending time with Lopez'stwins Emme and Max on several occasions. Seraphina also joined siblings Violet and Samuel, along with Emme and Max, ingiving away their parentsat their August 2022 wedding.\nGarner and Affleck's third child, Samuel, was born on Feb. 27, 2012. \"We are happy to announce on February 27, Jennifergave birth to a healthy baby boy, Samuel Garner Affleck,\" the actor posted on Facebook to share the happy news.\nAhead of welcoming Samuel, Garner toldEllen DeGeneres, \"It would be so weird to have a boy,\" adding that the experience would be \"cool and different.\"\nAfter giving birth to Samuel, Garner gave DeGeneres an update on her new life as a mom of three. \"I mean, [my daughters] didn't pee in my eye,\" she joked, before adding that her son is \"really, really, really sweet.\"\n\"I don't know if it's because he's a boy. I don't know if it's because he's my third and I forget that I have him,\" she continued. \"You're just dealing with two and then you think, 'I swear I put a baby down somewhere.' And you kind of walk through the house, 'There you are!' and he's just happy as can be.\"\nShe also shared an update on Samuel's personality. \"He reaches when he sees me and he laughs a lot,\" she said. \"He thinks I'm super funny. What more do you want?\"\nAs Samuel grew up, he seemed to have inherited a love of baseball from his dad, who's famously adie-hard Boston Red Sox fan. In 2019, Affleck told DeGeneres that he was thecoach of Samuel's Little League team. \"It's one of those things, you love it so much, it's like the dad dream,\" he said, explaining that he was so dedicated to the job, he had even pulled a few strings to be at every game.\n\"I had a game last week and I was promoting [Triple Frontier], and I was going to Asia and I was like, 'I have to come back a day early!' \" he said. \"And it was like, 'Whats the … ?' And I was like, 'My son's Little League game? I'm the coach.' But thank you, Netflix. They did let me [go].\"\nThat same year, Affleck recalled how he took matters into his own hands after Samuel told him he wasn't a New England Patriots fan.\nThe actor explained toJimmy Kimmelhow he tried to share some Boston sports history with Samuel before they headed to a World Series Red Sox game.\n\"I was telling my 6-year-old, my son in particular, you know, 'We're really excited because we're from Boston and this is a big deal and the Red Sox' and I'm giving him the whole history,\" Affleck told the host.\n\"And he listens to me and then he stops and goes, 'Dad. You're from Boston. I'm from L.A.,' \" Affleck continued. \"And I had a full existential crisis. 'I failed, I'm a bad father, this is a disaster, I don't know what to do!' \"\nRather than accept his son's L.A. fandom, Affleck decided to \"help him understand where he comes from. If not literally, then spiritually\" bydecking Samuel's room out in Patriots gear— including a giant football slide, a chair shaped like then-quarterbackTom Brady's head and life-sized poster of Brady on the wall.\n\"My ex-wife thinks it's creepy,\" he joked.\nAffleck's efforts seemed to have some effect on his son, as Samuel recently made a rare public appearance at a Boston Celtics game in December 2022, where hesat courtside with his dadat the Crypto.com Arena in L.A.\nIn February 2023, Samuel and theGone Girlstarattended the Ruffles Celebrity Gameduring NBA All-Star Weekend in Salt Lake City, Utah. The father-son duo had the honor of introducing the teams before the game, and while sitting courtside, they snapped a photo withShaquille O'Neal.\nPlaying basketball has become one of Samuel's hobbies — and Affleck is often in the stands cheering for his son (or yelling at the refs).\n\"I have found myself just this year really embarrassing myself. I was at a basketball game for 11-year-olds,loudly complaining about the inconsistencies of the traveling callsagainst [them],\" he admitted to PEOPLE. \"And I just was like, 'Get a hold of yourself.' I mean, listen, you don't want to be one of those parents.\"\nAffleck continued: \"It's that thing, I think, in modern parenting, especially. We want to help our children. We want them to succeed. We love them so much. And yet the real challenge is to get out of the way and let them do it on their own.\"",

Before welcoming her second child, Underwood talked to PEOPLE Now about theimportance of making room for family time.\n\"I remember when we first found out we were gonna have him [Isaiah], it [was] like, 'How are we gonna do this? Our lives are so crazy as it is,' \" she said. \"But you just make room, and you learn how important that family time is, and to be able to spend time and carve out some of that and maybe get to go on vacation and maybe get to go on a cruise — that stuff is so important to, like I said, make time for family. That's what it's all about.\"\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the singer was afforded the luxury of quality time with her sons as she was home from touring.\n\"I've never been in one place for this long in the past 15-plus years of my career,\" Underwood shared in avirtual interview with theTodayshow. \"So it's been really great to just really get to know them and watch them grow — especially Jake.

When we recorded, I was able to be in the booth with him and encourage him and try to remind him what words were coming up next, things like that,\" the singer told PEOPLE of the experience. \"I got to listen to his vocals [get] put together and then listening to myself with him. I was laughing, and I was crying, and it was just very overwhelming in a good way. It's just very emotional.\"\nAfter the song was released, Underwood revealed that Isaiah was quick toshare his debut with his classmates.\n\"He did such a great job, and listening back, I think he's just so proud of himself,\" she said. \"He went to school and he's like, 'Hey, my song's out!

If this isn't meant to happen, then I need to accept that and know that someday I'll understand why.' \"\nUnderwood often refers to Jacob as her \"miracle baby\" and marked his second birthday with a heartwarming tribute onInstagram.\n\"Jacob, we longed for you.

Now, they live “on the road” and stay in Airbnbs and hotels when Alan is on set.\nThe dad of three also has tattoos honoring his sons' unique names — a dove for Calem, a flame for Edan and a shield for Amory.\nAlan Ritchson/Instagram; Men's Health Magazine/TikTok (2)\nHere’s everything to know about Alan Ritchson’s kids: Calem, Edan and Amory.\nCat Ritchson/instagram\nAlan and Catherine welcomed their first son, Calem, on Sept. 19, 2012.\nHis name means “dove” in Latin, a symbol theFast Xactor had tattooed on his forearm in 2023.

So happy to ... I’d be lying if I said I didn’t leave after that to go cry. It all goes by way, way, way too fast.”\nThe actor continued, \"He’s a good reminder to me to do less of the things I’ll regret and relish in the finer things in life. Like these immortal games of airplane.

Her work has previously appeared in Food & Wine, Insider and Apartment Therapy.\nJeremy Strongmay be a star in front of the camera, but his wife, Emma Wall, works behind the scenes.\nWall, a Denmark-born documentary director, married theSuccessionstar in 2016 after meeting him at a party in 2012. Together, the couple shares three daughters.\nThough they tend to keep their relationship private, Wall chimed in during Strong's 2021interview withThe New Yorkerwhen asked if she noticed a difference in her award-winning husband while he was playing Kendall Roy.\n\"He does a really good job of maintaining what he's doing but also creating a space for the family and a normal life,\" she said. Strong said his wife's answer surprised him. \"I think she feels a sort of energy shift,\" he said. \"But it does make me feel like I'm living a double life.\"\nHere's everything to know about Jeremy Strong's wife, Emma Wall, and her relationship with the actor.\nStrong and Wall met in October 2012 at a party in New York being held during Hurricane Sandy.\nIn 2016, Strong and Wall tied the knot atDragsholm Slot, a castle in Zealand, Denmark. One of the oldest secular buildings in Denmark, the original castle was built around 1215, but it has undergone restorations over the years to conserve the building.\nWall is a child psychiatrist, whomost recently workedin the Los Angeles foster care system and as a clinician and educator at UCLA.\nShe received her BA from Brown University, and went on to attend Oxford University Medical School, where she graduated with honors. Wall completed her fellowship and residency at both Columbia University and Cornell University, and has worked with refugees and volunteered in hospitals around the world.\nIn addition to her work as a psychiatrist, Wall is also a documentary filmmaker and the co-founder of Guest House Productions. With her Guest House cofounder Betsy Hershey, she co-directedGuerilla Habeas, a documentary that tells the story of two lawyers fighting US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) over immigrants threatened by deportation.\n\"We started on this film at a time when I think so many of us were really appalled by what was happening in the immigration system,\" shetold Deadline. \"So we started this in the beginning of 2019, following the Muslim ban, following Trump's zero-tolerance policy that was separating families at the border. And we — as so many people, I think, in this country — were feeling incredibly helpless and hopeless. It felt like these grave injustices, these human rights violations, and we didn't know what to do about it.\"\nThe documentary had itsworld premiereat the Telluride Film Festival in September 2022, and premiered in February 2023 as a part of MSNBC's \"The Turning Point\" documentary series.\nStrong and Wall are the proud parents of three daughters: Ingrid, Clara and a third daughter whose name has not been shared.\nIn April 2018, Ingrid was born in Copenhagen after season one ofSuccessionwrapped filming. Strong says becoming a father changed him for the better.\n\"My life has changed a lot in the sense that there's some sort of stable center,\" hetoldGQin 2019. \"I never had that before — I was always just kind of a transient and work was the only thing. And that feels different now, in a very good way. There's something to come home to.\"\nClara was born in November 2019, and the father of two later shared a special way he keeps both of his daughters close to him. During a virtual appearance onThe Late Late Show With James Cordenin October 2020, Strongshowcased a custom necklacededicated to his girls.\n\"On the back is my daughter's footprint,\" he told the host, referencing his eldest daughter. \"And then my other daughter, I've got a bell. Her name is Clara, and the bell felt sort of clear and shining and bright, which is what her name means.\"\nWall and Strong welcomed a third daughter in September 2021, but have not publicly revealed her name.\nThe couple and their kids split their time between apartments in Brooklyn, New York, and Copenhagen, Denmark. During the COVID-19 pandemic, they bought a summer home in Tisvilde, Denmark, a seaside town north of Copenhagen.\n\"I love Denmark. I find it a very sane and gentle place,\" StrongtoldThe Guardianin 2021. \"It feels like a refuge for me, and it's great to have somewhere that's a docking station after all this work, which I find very enervating and scary and stressful.\"\nWhether it's a movie premiere, an awards show or the Met Gala, Wall rarely misses a chance to support Strong.\nIn March 2023, she accompanied her husband to the season 4 premiere ofSuccessionin New York City, and two months later, Wall and Strong walked the red carpet at fashion's biggest night: The Met Gala.\nTheSuccessionstar donned a brown Prada jacket, a ruffled green button-up and a neon flower necklace by Homer —Frank Ocean's jewelry brand.

        "body": "Actor Gene Hackman and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, were found dead at their home in Santa Fe Summit on Feb. 26\nNicole Briese is a contributing writer at PEOPLE. She has been working at PEOPLE since 2022. Her work has previously appeared in Us Weekly, Brides and MTV News.\nTwo-time Oscar winnerGene Hackmanwas found dead at his Santa Fe home on Feb. 26, along with his wife Betsy Arakawa and their dog.\nHackman and Arakawa were reported dead by theSanta Fe New Mexican, citing County Sheriff Adan Mendoza. He said that there was no indication of foul play in the deaths, per the outlet.\nThough Hackman was famed for iconic roles inThe French ConnectionandSuperman, little is known about the woman with whom he shared his life.\nWhile the two reportedly began dating in the mid-'80s, Hackman made it clear totheSouth Florida Sun-Sentinelthat he did not abandon his first wife,Faye Maltese, to whom he was wed from 1956 to 1986, for Arakawa.\nDiscussing his similarities to his character Harry Mackenzie in 1985'sTwice in a Lifetime, he said: \"By the way, I did not leave my real-life wife for a younger woman. We just drifted apart. We lost sight of each other. When you work in this business, marriage takes a great deal of work and love.\"\nBy 1990, Hackman and Arakawa were sharing a home in Santa Fe, New Mexico. That same year, he underwent angioplasty due to congestive heart failure — something that convinced him in part to retire from making films, perAARP The Magazine.\n\"I haven't held a press conference to announce retirement, but yes, I'm not going to act any longer,\" he toldReutersin 2008. \"I really don't want to do it any longer.\"\nHe pivoted to writing, publishing his first book,Wake of the Perdido Star, in 1999, and has since written at least four others, includingPayback at Morning Peak— a Western set in and inspired by his life in Santa Fe.\nIn 2014, Hackman told the podcastWriter's Bonethat Arakawa, whom he married in 1991, helped him to hone his writing. \"If in fact I have a style, it came from repeated edits, friends' suggestions, and my wife's unwavering, specific read-throughs,\" he said.\nSo, who was Gene Hackman's wife? Here's everything to know about Betsy Arakawa and her relationship with the actor.\nAccording toTheNew York Times, the actor met his future bride at a gym in California, where Arakawa worked part-time while pursuing a career in classical music. Arakawa was reportedly born in Hawaii in the early '60s.\nThough Hackman and Arakawa don't have children together, she is a stepmom to theHeartbreakersstar'sthree kidsfrom his previous marriage to Maltese: son Christopher Allen and daughters Leslie Anne and Elizabeth Jean.\nWhile speaking to theIrish Independentin 2000, the actor said of his kids, \"It's tough being the son or daughter of a celebrity. I couldn't always be home with them when they were growing up and then, living in California, they've had my success always hanging over their heads.\"\nIn addition to having worked at a fitness center, Arakawa is a skilled musician who is a classically trained pianist, according to theNew York Post.\nHackman and Arakawa's Santa Fe home was featured inArchitectural Digestin April 1990. Though the home had rough beginnings (\"The house was horrible,\" architect Stephen Samuelson said of the formerly abandoned 1950s block building), the couple worked to make their space \"light and soaring\" with an open floor plan and a blend of the pueblo and colonial New Mexico and Spanish Baroque styles.\nInvolved with \"every aspect of the house,\" Hackman determined the floor plan, mixed paint colors and specified details — but not without the help of his spouse.\nWhen Hackman was away filming, Arakawa took charge, consulting with her partner over the phone and sending him photos. The couple procured their furniture locally and from boutiques around the world, including in New York, California and Germany.\nWith no known social media and no interviews about herself or her love life, Arakawa appeared to be an extremely private individual — something that Hackman told theIrish Independentwas largely by design.\n\"Where we live, in Santa Fe, you can lead your own life and not be bothered by the latest gossip,\" he said.\nAccording to Hackman's bio withSimon & Schuster, he and Arakawa shared their home with two German shepherds. They previously had three: In 1999, the couple adopted a third, according toTheBaltimore Sun.\nWhile Hackman was filmingThe Replacementsin Baltimore, two strays wandered onto the set. The actor had them brought to a local shelter, which named the dogs Gene and Keanu, after Hackman and his costarKeanu Reeves. The couple adopted the one named Gene.\nIn 2020, Hackman gave fans a glimpse into his private life with Arakawa in an interview withEmpire. As he told the outlet, the two regularly watched DVDs that Arakawa rents. \"We like simple stories that some of the little low-budget films manage to produce,\" he said.\nHe also shared their weekend ritual. \"Friday night is set aside for a Comedy Channel marathon, with particular attention paid toEddie Izzard,\" the outlet reported. \"The speed of thought is amazing,\" Hackman said.\nHackman and Arakawa were found dead in their Santa Fe home on Feb. 26. TheSanta Fe New Mexicanfirst broke the news, citing County Sheriff Mendoza.\nThe sheriff added that their dog was also found dead and did not provide a cause of death or say when the couple might have passed.",

Because it's an English team that is not part of the EU but they have commercial activities in Europe.\n\"It's really important that all clubs are subject to transparency rules and governance and real competition in the financial and sporting side of their business.\"\nLaLiga states that the club receives resources under non-market conditions that disrupt several closely related markets, which enable the club to sign top-tier players and coaches far beyond what would be feasible under normal market conditions and to secure sponsorship revenues at levels that do not align with fair market value.\nLaLiga says this improves Man City's performance on the pitch, while restricting its rival's capacity.\nIt is understood meetings have been held, but LaLiga is awaiting a decision and/or further progress from the European Commission.\nMan City say Tebas has a long history of attacking the club and refused to comment.\nBut they strongly refute the allegations and pointed to their accounts as proof of no wrongdoing which are a matter of public record.\nSky Sports Newshas contacted the EU Commission for comment.\nLaLiga's legal complaint is separate and unrelated to the 115 charges Man City are facing over alleged breaches of the Premier League's financial regulations. Man City denied all of the charges.\nTom from Southampton became a millionaire for free with Super 6! Could you be the next jackpot winner? Play for free!\n© 2025 Sky UK",

We have to choose someone to go out, we have to think about set pieces also, so it was my choice.\"\nIt is not the first time Garnacho has faced the wrath of Amorim, with the winger left out of United's derby win over Manchester City along with Rashford, though his manager said he had \"changed\" in the weeks after the exclusion, hence his reinstatement.\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\nAmorim also leapt to the defence of wing-back Dorgu after he was sent off against Ipswich.\nDorgu's mix-up with Andre Onana gifted Ipswich the opener in the fourth minute before the 20-year-old was then sent off for his challenge onOmari Hutchinson just before half-time.\n\"Today I am not frustrated,\" he toldTNT Sports. \"We scored two goals and the sending off changed the game. The guys showed and our fans helped a lot, we fully deserved the win.\n\"He [Dorgu] is ready because he proved in the last game. Any player can have a mistake like today and the sending-off, he wants to play the ball. It was harsh how he went for the ball.

He was shown a straight red card for his challenge on Omari Hutchinson just before the break.\nDERMOT SAYS:\"It's fantastic [intervention from VAR] because if you look at another angle, it's a really bad challenge.\n\"I'm not saying he means to do it, but it's a really mistimed challenge.\n\"He's caught him up the shin, he's come from distance, he's got speed, hitting with the studs. VAR have told Darren England to go and look at it, which he did and it's a red.\n\"Because of the referee's position, he doesn't see the magnitude of that foul. He actually restarted with a throw-in so he didn't think it was a foul.\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\"When he's gone to the screen, he's realised he's got it wrong. That's what it's for.\"\nStream Sky Sports on NOW\nWatch FREE PL highlights on the app\nLive Premier League table\nGet Sky Sports\nINCIDENT:Earlier in the first half Alejandro Garnacho wanted a penalty, but was Darren England right to wave this away?\nDERMOT SAYS:\"100 per cent. He's felt contact and gone down too easily.\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\"The referee got that right because he's worked hard to get into that position. He's seen it and can almost hear the minimal contact and says no.\"\nINCIDENT:Haaland thought he'd scored his second goal of the game against Spurs in stoppage time, but it was ruled out for handball.\nThe Premier League Match Centre said: \"The referee's call of no goal for a handball by Haaland was checked and confirmed by VAR - with no conclusive evidence to overturn the on-field decision\".\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\nDERMOT SAYS:\"Everybody thinks this rule is harsh unless it goes in. Jarred Gillett, the referee, is the key. He gives the handball. He whistles before Haaland goes on.\n\"VAR checked and checked and they concluded that there was no evidence the referee was wrong.\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\"I would say the evidence supports the referee... because he's the goalscorer, it has to be disallowed.\n\"The key issue is it was disallowed by the referee on-field.\"\nINCIDENT:In Liverpool's win over Newcastle, there was an early shout for a Liverpool penalty for a challenge from Lewis Hall on Mohamed Salah\nDERMOT SAYS:\"Again, this is all about the referee. He feels that Hall has been barged by Salah outside the box.\n\"If Stuart Attwell hadn't given a foul on Hall, it's 100 per cent a penalty because he's brought Salah down.\n\"But the referee whistled for the first foul on Hall, so a free-kick for Newcastle rather than a penalty for Liverpool.\"\nINCIDENT:There was also a goal disallowed late on in the game for a foul by Ibrahima Konate on Nick Pope.\nDERMOT SAYS:\"It's the right call. Konate has his arms on Pope's shoulder as the goalkeeper is about to grab the ball and he drops it.\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\"The expectation of everybody is a free-kick. The Newcastle players react immediately, the Liverpool players almost anticipate it's going to come.\n\"It's an easy foul to give if you spot it.\"\nINCIDENT:In the draw between Nottingham Forest and Arsenal, Forest claimed for a penalty after Riccardo Calafiori made contact with Callum Hudson-Odoi in the box.\nWas this enough for a penalty?\nDERMOT SAYS:\"That's the crux of it - was there enough? I think not. There's a bit of contact but is it enough to put him off? I'm not sure.\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\"Calafiori goes to pull out of the challenge, the forward also isn't convinced it's a foul, he's trying to get the ball. He topples over but he's off balance anyhow.\n\"For me, the referee has got that right, and play on.\"\nINCIDENT:Jurrien Timber's cross appeared to strike the arm of Chris Wood inside the Forest box. Was this handball?\nDERMOT SAYS:\"This is where the forward wins with the law because if he scores from that, it's disallowed.\n\"But the law is quite clear here, if he's on the floor, it's a supporting arm and it can't be given as handball.\n\"He's doing everything possible to get out of the way. Nobody wants a penalty for that because it just doesn't sit right with people.\"\nINCIDENT:Brighton were awarded a penalty against Bournemouth when Joao Pedro was fouled by Kepa Arrizabalaga.\nThe decision was given on-field by Michael Oliver and confirmed by VAR.\nAndoni Iraola believes Joao Pedro bought the penalty and forgot about trying to score. Whether that is true or not, was this the correct decision?\nDERMOT SAYS:\"Definitely. The clue is in the ball for me. Once the player moves the ball past the goalkeeper, he has to make sure that he doesn't take the forward down.\n\"He will say he's always there, but he takes Pedro down and it's a penalty.\n\"He's stopped the player and rushed out. People say 'what can he do?' but if he doesn't do that, Pedro will just run the ball into an empty net.\n\"Kepa doesn't get the ball and Pedro is clever, that's what forwards are taught to do - protect the ball from the goalkeeper, which he's done.\n\"Once he's done that, the goalkeeper has to stand his ground, which he doesn't.\"\nINCIDENT:Wolves claimed for a penalty when Marshall Munetsi went down in the box after contact from Issa Diop. The appeals were waved away by Peter Bankes.\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\nDERMOT SAYS:\"There's a bit of contact [for the penalty claim], but the two players come together.\n\"The player is already on the way down. He almost feels Diop bouncing off him rather than being fouled by him.\"\nINCIDENT:In Crystal Palace's win against Aston Villa, there was a really tight offside call against Ollie Watkins. Did they get to the right decision?\nDERMOT SAYS:\"If the technology said they did, then it's factual. People get frustrated because it's tight, but what we asked for at the start was for offside to be yes or no.\n\"You have to be careful what you wish for... the technology shows it's just offside. This weekend in the FA Cup, they're trialling semi-automated offsides so there'll be another move into a different area, and hopefully people will embrace that.\n\"I think it'll work really well.\"\nINCIDENT:At Brentford, Beto was through on goal. Ethan Pinnock slipped and brought Beto down as last man, but the Everton striker got up and carried on. Had he stayed down, would this have been a red?\nDERMOT SAYS:\"I don't think there's any doubt. It's one of the most unusual situations I've seen.\n\"The forward has thought 'I can score, I want to go on', but he gets up so quickly, the referee thinks he has a better chance on his own.\n\"As it was, it didn't come off. But if he's stopped on the ground, a red card.\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\"Pinnock hasn't denied it because Beto has picked himself up and he's still through on goal. That was key for the referee and he's played the advantage. It's a tough call.\"\nINCIDENT:Brentford had a goal ruled out in the second half. Yoane Wissa tapped in but it was ruled out for offside despite Jarrad Branthwaite being on the line.\nDERMOT SAYS:\"It's a brilliant spot from the linesman because Pickford comes out and he's actually behind Pickford.\n\"There's only one defender behind and there has to be two defenders. People think only one because the goalkeeper is usually there so the law is two defenders.\n\"Usually it's one plus the goalkeeper but as soon as Pickford goes past the forward, he's in an offside position.\"\nINCIDENT:An interesting one in the Rangers game last night. The referee originally gives a goal-kick after Ianis Hagi's shot goes out of play.\nHe changed his mind, and Rangers scored from the resulting corner that was given.\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\nDERMOT SAYS:\"This is one of two in Scotland last night that it becomes consequence rather than decision made.\n\"I do think this is a corner. It does strike the defender. The referee gives a goal-kick but he's probably had some input and he gives a corner.\n\"It becomes a talking point because they scored from it.\"\nTom from Southampton became a millionaire for free with Super 6!

Instead, they have powered on.\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\nThe absence of Erling Haaland and Alexander Isak for these last two fixtures made the task of two clean sheets slightly easier but what is impressive is how they have approached it all, underlining their superiority with their sheer relentlessness.\nSeven of the Liverpool starting line-up have started all five games in a fortnight. Players were rested where possible, rotation up front and at full-back, but the energy that Dominik Szoboszlai continues to bring to the team is remarkable. Player of the match.\nAs for Mohamed Salah, there he was in the 97th minute of the match, running at young Lewis Hall again to win a corner. Arsenal were hoping for a slip. Instead, it is they who have caved. Liverpool are the best team this season. The Premier League title awaits.Adam Bate\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\nWhere would Manchester United be without Bruno Fernandes?\nWatch FREE PL highlights on the app\nLive Premier League table\nStream Sky Sports on NOW\nDownload the Sky Sports App\nHe is the shining light through the grey skies at Old Trafford. There is a lot of dross in this United squad but one constant remains in that Fernandes is a world-class talent with a world-class mentality.\nWhen things aren't going United's way, he is the one that wants the ball and gets them playing. When United can't create quality chances from open play, he pings in deliveries that change the game.\nFollowing on from dragging his team back into the game at Everton, he provided a game-changing moment on three occasions in this bizarre game, making Ipswich panic to the extreme as United completely battered them from set-piece situations. All three United goals stemmed from his sumptuous deliveries.\nOf the 0.72 worth of total expected goals United created, 0.58 of that came from corners and free-kicks, supplied by the magic of Fernandes' right foot. He isn't perfect but right now, he's United's go-to guy.Lewis Jones\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\nAfter two blanks in four days against West Ham and Nottingham Forest, Arsenal have failed to score in back-to-back Premier League games for the first time since May 2023. Factor in the Carabao Cup loss at Newcastle and it's three games out of four in which they have not found the net.\nThey can't score but creating chances is probably a bigger issue than taking them for this Arsenal side right now. Without Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli as well as strikers Kai Havertz and Gabriel Jesus, they lack creators as well as finishers.\nAgainst Forest, their 13 shots were worth only 0.97 expected goals. It was a similar story in the defeat to West Ham, during which they racked up 20 shots worth a meagre 1.22 expected goals. Their figure was even lower against Newcastle, at 0.77. Poor finishing is only one part of the problem as they struggle to create clear chances.\nWith Odegaard badly out of form and no other available creative options in the squad, it was hardly surprising to hear Mikel Arteta highlight the issue afterwards. \"We lacked that final ball, that spark to generate something, to open them up and have more shots on target.\"\nIn what is likely to be a vital summer transfer window for the club, adding creativity, as well as goal threat, will need to be a priority.Nick Wright\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\nIt was Ange Postecoglou this week who dismissed 'assists' as a relevant stat. Jeremy Doku might be feeling the same way after his two electric performances in the space of four days earned a grand total of zero goal involvements.\nAgainst Liverpool on Sunday, he skipped past Trent Alexander-Arnold a record number of times. At Tottenham on Wednesday, he played the cross for Erling Haaland's winner (although a deflection denied him the assist) and then saw Haaland and Savinho pass up glorious opportunities to convert from more good work from the Belgian.\nDoku may have recorded four assists in one match against Bournemouth in his first season at City but right now he is playing his best football since coming to the club. The assist numbers may not show it but the opposition full-backs will surely confirm it. He's a thrilling watch.Peter Smith\nIf you take away Jaden Philogene's first goal which was an open goal gifted to him, Ipswich created just 0.48 worth of expected goals against Manchester United and didn't force Andre Onana into a save until the 88th minute.\nThis came against a team playing with 10 players for 50 minutes and one that had lost five of their previous six games at Old Trafford. Confidence was fragile but Ipswich allowed United to grow.\nThis was a big opportunity for Kieran McKenna's men to get their season moving in the direction of safety. But they froze under the pressure of having to take the game to Manchester United.. There was no spark. Just lots of safe passing in front of the United low block that soaked up the timid attacking from the visitors with ease.\nLiam Delap was marshalled by three defenders at times and when you stop the service into him, you stop Ipswich. Time is running out for them to forge a great escape. On this showing, they have little hope.Lewis Jones\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\nWhile on the surface a draw away from home against a spirited Brentford side would often be a result most managers would be happy with, David Moyes will be left frustrated that Everton couldn't capitalise on the numerous opportunities they were able to conjure up at the Gtech Community Stadium.\nGoals from Yoane Wissa and Jake O'Brien meant that the spoils were shared, but it could've been so different if the Toffees, and more specifically Beto, had been more clinical. The striker has been in terrific form of late, scoring five goals in four Premier League games before Wednesday.\nHowever, he couldn't carry that hot streak on as he spurned three glorious one-on-one opportunities. The first saw him try and run past Mark Flekken in goal to no avail. Minutes later, an even better chance came his way, but he couldn't slot past the onrushing Dutchman. He was left to rue these efforts, as Wissa pounced to notch the opener before half-time.\nThen, with 88 minutes on the clock, the 27-year-old found himself in acres of space inside the penalty area and with a chance to win the game, but his placed effort still wasn't enough to defy the Brentford No 1 - who was labelled as the player of the match by Brentford boss Thomas Frank.\nHaving scored in his previous four straight league matches, Moyes will hope these misses don't lead to a U-turn of the promise that he has so far shown under his new manager.\nRegardless, the fact that Everton were able to create so many clear opportunities for the striker is something they can be pleased with. It underpins the Toffees improved attacking output under their new boss, as they have already matched the number of goals they managed in Sean Dyche's 20 games prior.\nIt could've been three points in west London had Beto been able to replicate his recent efforts. But, the fact remains that Moyes has given Everton fans something to cheer, and opposition teams more to fear.Callum Bishop\nTom from Southampton became a millionaire for free with Super 6!

I am impressed by the quality they have, they are on a similar run as we are, having hardly lost any games for a long time.\n\"That is my main focus.

How English teams could have up to seven spots in next season's tournament if Manchester United or Tottenham win the Europa League\nThursday 27 February 2025 08:28, UK\nThe last 16 of this year's Champions League has not even begun but with the  Premier League home straight in sight, thoughts are already turning to qualifying for next year's tournament.\nThe race for the top four - or most likely five, but we will come back to that later - is pretty tight, as only six points separate Nottingham Forest in third and Aston Villa all the way down in 10th, with up to 33 points left to play for.\nLiverpoolandArsenallook certain to reach next season's Champions League and enjoy 21-point and eight-point buffers over fifth spot already. Opta give Liverpool a 100 per cent chance of finishing in the top four, with Arsenal only a tad less likely with a 99.9 per cent chance.\nBehind them there are more than half a dozen teams, includingManchester CityandChelsea- but also surprise packagesForestandBournemouth- in with a shot of making it over the line. With the teams so tightly bunched, things can change very quickly.\nNottingham Forest boosted their chances by holding second-placed Arsenal to a goalless draw at the City Ground, avoiding a run of three straight defeats.\nNewcastle, meanwhile, have seen a bump in the road after a 2-0 defeat to runaway league leaders Liverpool made it three league defeats in four matches. That allowed Man City to climb into fourth place via a 1-0 win over lowly Tottenham.\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\nChelsea have also climbed into the top five via a 4-0 win over bottom club Southampton to slightly boost their chances of reaching the Champions League.\nLive Premier League table\nStream Sky Sports on NOW\nWatch FREE PL highlights on the app\nPremier League fixtures\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\nBournemouth's Champions League dream took a hit following back-to-back defeats to Wolves andBrighton, who have now moved level on points with the Cherries following that victory.\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\nMeanwhile, Aston Villa'scredentials took a hit as they were beaten 4-1 by Crystal Palace, with Unai Emery's side currently undergoing some sketchy form.\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\nAnd areFulhamin the mix now after their 2-1 win over Wolves lifted them up to ninth?Brentford's chances of Europe took a hit as they were held to a 1-1 draw by Everton.\nIt is not certain but is very likely that England will have at least five spots in next season's Champions League for the first time since 2017/18, owing to the Premier League's performance in Europe.\nSix of the seven English teams involved in European competition this season have made it through to the last 16 of their respective tournaments, with only Man City absent following their Champions League play-off defeat to Real Madrid.\nThat puts England comfortably at the top of the charts for its European coefficient this season, which is an accumulation of wins and draws picked up by each country's sides and further points awarded for how far they make it in each continental competition.\nThe top-two ranked countries at the end of the season will receive an extra Champions League place next season, with Italy and Spain currently battling it out for second spot.\nA word of caution, though. England was comfortably top of the UEFA coefficient list for much of last season before a raft of eliminations from European competition saw their hopes of an extra qualifying disappear, confining fifth-placed Tottenham to this season's Europa League instead of the Champions League.\nShould the Premier League's representatives on the continent find themselves on the wrong end of some more tricky draws, the same thing could happen this time around.\nThere is another way England could end up with five - or perhaps even six spots. That outcome would occur if either of Tottenham or Manchester United win this season's Europa League while also finishing outside of the qualifying spots in the Premier League.\nThere may still be 11 matches to go but Opta has given both Liverpool and Arsenal an almost certain chance of reaching next season's Champions League owing to their buffer over the teams below them and the difficulty of their remaining fixtures relative to the other sides in the race.\nWith that in mind, Man City are third-favourites to qualify for next season's tournament despite sitting behind Forest in the table - with their win over Spurs seeing their top-five chances going from 86 per cent to 91.8 per cent. Pep Guardiola's side also have a 82.8 per cent chance of finishing in the top four.\nNuno Espirito Santo's Forest have the next-best chance of rounding off the top four with a 40.8 per cent chance, but they are closely followed by Chelsea (32.7 per cent) and Newcastle (26.7 per cent).\nThe top five situation looks better for Forest, who have a 62.3 per cent chance of securing that feat which will likely secure Champions League football next season. But again, Chelsea (54 per cent) and Newcastle (47.9 per cent) are also in the mix.\nBournemouth's defeat to Brighton has given the Cherries' chances a real dent, with their likelihood of a top-five finishing dropping to 22.2 per cent - meaning they are twice as likely to miss out compared to Newcastle and Chelsea.\nMeanwhile, Brighton's chances have been given a minor boost with their top-five percentages jumping to 14.1 per cent - which is greater than Fulham (3 per cent), Aston Villa (4.2 per cent), Brentford (0.6 per cent) and Crystal Palace (0.3 per cent) combined.\nSpurs, meanwhile, saw their very slim chances of a top five finish (0.5 per cent) extinguish to 0 per cent.\nBut with the Premier League top half so tight, all of that could easily change over the next three months.\nHere is the average position of each Premier League side's next five opponents, taking them right into the final throes of the season...\nTeams included with a one-per-cent or greater chance of qualifying:\nTom from Southampton became a millionaire for free with Super 6!

I think, with the manager coming in, he's helped us all express ourselves and the team's done really well.\"\nWhat were your first impressions of Regis Le Bris?\"I definitely realised quite early on that he was really calculated in his work and he likes to analyse and he gives you a lot of feedback, which is really good as a player because you want to know where you stand.\n\"You want to know, for me anyway, how you can improve and get better all the time. He's a really calming figure to have on the touchline as well. Probably a contrast to the fans in the stadium, but he's really calm, which gives us a lot of freedom as young players to express ourselves.\"\nFirst goal of the season [against Derby], talk us through this one...\"I just saw the ball pop up out to me and I thought about my first touch, and that was it. I thought about getting the ball out of my feet and shooting.\"\nIt looks like it might take a deflection on that angle, but it doesn't, does it?\"No chance, no!\"\nAre you always looking to try and find the opportunity to have a shot?\"To be honest, I'm not really. My mum always tells me to shoot more.\"\nStream the Championship on NOW\nLive EFL 2024/25 fixtures on Sky Sports+\nLive Championship table\nDownload the Sky Sports app\nThe Illan Meslier mistake when you played Leeds. What are your memories of that?\"I wasn't thinking much, to be honest. I was just running over to the fans in the corner. It was chaos, really. No one that I spoke to had any idea what had happened until we'd seen the replay.\"\nAnother goal here against Oxford, header this time. Tell us about this one...\"Well, heading is something I've tried to improve, being so tall. I hope I've stopped [growing] now!\"\nFirst red card vs QPR. How do you look back on this?\"Well, it's definitely a red card. I checked if he was all right and took my medicine. I apologised to the lads and I got off the pitch.\"\nThe Swansea comeback on your return after suspension?\"We weren't good in the first half of this game and then in the second half we were really locked in and focused. Dan scored a great goal there.\"\nSo you set up the second, the equaliser, and then you go and score the third.\"It was the least I could do, to be honest.\"\nDo you think of the four teams at the top you've been underestimated the most?\"A lot of people have a lot to say about our age and lack of experience, you might say, but I don't see it that way. I think, for a young squad, we've got a lot of experience and we've got a lot of character and fearlessness as well.\"\nThe late win against Boro, was it a statement from you?\"Yeah, for sure. Middlesbrough are a really, really good team. They play some really good football and they try and play through the middle of you, which they did for that first goal. To be honest, it probably wasn't one of our best performances, but we were decisive. In games like this, it doesn't always have to be pretty, you've just got to find a way to win.\"\nWhat about this promotion race?\"The way I see it, there's three of the top teams competing for promotion to one of the best leagues in the world. It's really healthy, actually, for the squad, because it keeps us something to chase, keeps our standards high in the training ground and then in games as well.\n\"It's been great for all of us and hopefully we want to end the season as high as possible, give our all until the end and we'll see where that takes us.\"\nTom from Southampton became a millionaire for free with Super 6!

So far it has proved to be the correct decision, results have turned and we have gone from looking like a poor bottom-half side to serious play-off contenders playing decent football - even with key players missing during his tenure, such as Haji Wright, Mason-Clark and captain Ben Sheaf.\nThere has been a real sense of uplift in spirit and feeling around the club. Signings such as Grimes and Jamie Paterson have added real Championship experience to the horde of arrivals last summer, and showed Lampard's intent to really push for promotion.\nIt seemed unthinkable a few months ago that we'd be able to move on from Robins as our leader in the dugout. But the results have been so good under Lampard and he's now having his name chanted among the home support.\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\nSky Sports EFL editor Simeon Gholam:\nLampard managed one full season in the Championship before, taking Derby County to the play-off final, where they lost at Wembley to Aston Villa.\nThat campaign, 2018/19, was one of the most dramatic in recent second-tier history, with Marcelo Bielsa, 'Spygate' and their incredible semi-final comeback over Leeds United.\nDespite falling just short, Lampard did enough to earn a move back to Chelsea that summer, and since then there have been several fairly different takes on whether he was a success at Derby or not.\nHe built a side around several young loanees - notably Mason Mount, Fikayo Tomori and Harry Wilson, who provided obvious quality at this level but were all still young at the time. Some since have suggested a team with that core should have finished higher than sixth and earned promotion, but they were up against a Villa side fielding the likes of John McGinn, Tyrone Mings, Jack Grealish and Tammy Abraham. And that team only finished fifth.\nDerby did not fare well in the years after, and some of the spending that season on wages certainly did not help. But broadly, from my perspective, Lampard did a good job for that year purely from a coaching capacity.\nHe had the ability to succeed at this level, and taking over a wildly underachieving Coventry side has proved fruitful so far. The last two play-off places are wide open, and Lampard's side currently look well-placed to stroll through that door.\nOnce there in the end-of-season showdown, anything is possible.\nNo winner of the £2M, no problem. There is another chance to win £1,000,000 with Super 6 this weekend!\n© 2025 Sky UK",
